"One of the other reviewers mentioned that after watching the 1 Oz episode, they would fall in love. That's right because this is what happened with me. <br /> <br /> The first thing that surprised me about Oz was the scene of brutality and brutal violence. It started with the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for a faint-hearted or timid person. The show is not punched for drugs, sex or violence. It is hardcore in the classic use of the word. <br /> <br /> Owald is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary and is called OZ. Privacy is not high on the agenda as it focuses on Emerald City, the experimental area of ​​the prison where all cells face the glass front and face inside. There are many places in Em City. .Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and etc... Shuffle, Death Star, Dodge deals and shady deals are never far. <br /> <br /> The main attraction of this show is that other shows won't dare. Forget the pretty pictures drawn for the mainstream audience, forget the charm, forget the romance... OZ is not a mess. The first episode I saw surprised me because it was surreal. I couldn't say I was ready to do that, but when I saw more, I developed Oz's taste and got used to the high level of graphic violence. Watching the odds of violence as well as injustice (a crooked guard to be sold for Nickel, an inmate to be orderly conquered, an intermediate prisoner who excuses prison assassination for lack of street skills), or a prison experience), you can get used to uncomfortable viewing... If you can get in touch with your dark side.","One of the other reviewers says he will be hooked after seeing only one Oz episode.

"Nice little production. <br /> <br /> The shooting technique is very homely, BBB way a long time ago, and it comforts the whole piece and sometimes makes it uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The actors were extremely well selected. Michael Sheen cut off all the voices ""not only got all the Polaries""! You can truly see the complete compilation guided by reference to Williams' diary entries. It's not only worth seeing, it's a wonderfully written and performed piece. A great production for a comedy and one of the great masters of his life. <br /> <br /> There are actually small things in realism. Instead of using traditional'dream' techniques, the illusion of a guard that remains solid disappears. It affects our knowledge and senses. In particular, the scenes and sets about Orton and Halliwell (especially the flat scenes with Halliwell's murals decorating all surfaces) perform very well.","A wonderful little piece.<br /> <br /> The shooting technique is a very discreet, very old fashioned BBC fashion that gives the whole piece a pleasant and sometimes unpleasant reality.<br /> <br /> The actor is very well selected-Michael Sheen not only ""got all the polari"" but he also putts all voices! You can really see a seamless edit guided by a reference to Williams' diary entry.Not only is it worth a look, but it's a very written and played piece.A stunning piece about one of the comedy masters and his life.<br /> <br /> Realism is reborn by the little things.Rather than using the traditional ""dream"" technique, the illusion of a solid guard disappears and disappears.It affects our knowledge and our senses, especially the sets and sets relating to Orton and Halliwell, especially the flat sets where Halliwell's murals decorate all surfaces."
"I thought this was a great way to spend time on a hot summer weekend and sit in an air-conditioned theater and watch a light comedy. The plot is simple, but the conversation is witty, and the character is likable (even the well-known bread serial killer). These are Match Point 2:. You may have been disappointed to know that it wasn't a Risk Addiction, but I thought Woody Allen was still in full control of the styles that many of us liked.<br /> <br /> This has been a Woody comedy for years It's the funniest thing in one (do you say 10 years?). Although I wasn't impressed by Scarlett Johansson, she darkened her ""sexy"" image and jumped into an average but passionate young woman. <br /> <br /> This may not be the crown jewel, it was more fun than ""Devil Wears Prada"", more interesting than ""Superman"" and a comedy to see with friends.","I thought it was a great way to spend a hot summer weekend sitting in an air-conditioned theater and watching a comedy comedy.The plot is simplified, but the dialogue is witty and the character is welcoming (even for serial murderers who appear to be While some are disappointed to notice that Matchpoint 2 isn't a risk addiction, I thought it was evidence that Woody Allen had complete control over the style that many began to love.<br /> <br /> This was the most I' ve laughed at one of Woody's comedies over the years (I'm not saying 10 years?).I have never been impressed with Scarlett Johansson, but this tightened her ""sexy"" image and jumped into an average, energetic young woman.<br /> <br /> This may not be a crown jewel.In his career, it was smarter than ""the devil wears Prada"" and more interesting than ""Superman,"" a great comedy to go out with friends."

"Petter Mattei's “Love for Money” is a visually stunning film. Mattei gives a vivid portrait of human relationships. This is a movie that tells people what money, strength, and success are in the various situations we face. <br /> <br /> This is a variation on Arthur Schnitzler's play on the same subject, where the director transfers the action to New York where all these characters meet and connect. Each person is connected in one way or another, but no one knows the previous contact. Stylishly, the movie gives a luxurious and luxurious feel. We see how these people live and their world lives in their own habitat. <br /> <br /> The only thing you get from all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness that each person lives in.

"Perhaps my favorite movie, selfless story, sacrifice and dedication to noble reasons, but I will not preach or get bored. I've seen it more than 15 times in the past 25 years, but I'm never getting older. Paul Lukas' performances shed tears, and Bette Davis is a delight, one of the almost sympathetic roles. As the grandmothers said, children are more like ""kids in clothes"" than children, but it's more fun just watching.

"This show was an amazing, fresh and innovative idea when it first aired in the 70s. The first 7 to 8 years was great, but after that the situation fell. By 1990, the show was no longer fun, and continues to decline due to today's complete waste of time. Writing is painful and performance is almost bad. The show will still not air unless you take a little pleasant break from the guest host. It is too hard to believe that the same creator who chose the original cast himself chose the following hack band. How can you perceive such brilliance and replace it with such mediocrity? I felt that this show should give me two stars for the original cast with such great success. As now, the show is terrible.

"Thanks to the positive comments about this film, I was looking forward to seeing it. Bad mistake. I watched over 950 movies, which is one of the worst. It's terrible in almost every way.

The scariest scene was a man eating a large bird, helplessly hanging from the air with a parachute. fear. fear. <br /> <br /> As a young kid going to see A Cheese B movie on Saturday afternoon, I'm still tired of the formula for this monster-type movie that includes a hero.

I like them because of unintentional humor. <br /> <br /> But about a year later, I watched when Psycho came out and I liked the movie Janet Leigh hitting the beginning of the movie.

"So I'm not a fan who likes Ball's work, but not many. I enjoyed his movie mail. Boll bought the right to use Far Cry for a long time even before the game itself ended. <br /> <br /> Those who killed the soldiers on the tropical island and infiltrated the Secret Labs should be warned that this is not extremely crying... This is what Bol planned with his legion schmucks.. loneliness on the set Mr. Boll invites to play with his three country people. These players use the names of Til Schweiger, Udo Kier, and Ralf Moeller. <br /> <br /> Jack Carver, played by Til Schweiger, three names that actually gained great popularity in movie beads (eg!! Carver is the most demanding food for all Germans). However, the Tils acting in this movie was found to be pretty bad, sticking to the whole Carver agenda, but we saw only the sculptor at the first person point of view, so we don't really know what he was kicking on.. <br /> <br /> But the story of this is that the film is deadly. There is a reason for conducting a top secret study on an island reminiscent of evil scientist Krieger Dr. ""SPOILER"" Vancouver, played by Udo Kier. We didn't go to the FAR before I started crying. I can't go any further. If you want to keep the truth to the Bolls shenanigans, you won't be disappointed by watching this movie. It gives you a true Boll experience. Most of it will be faster.<br /> <br /> There's an English class like Boll fighting a nice boat, everything makes me laugh until the entire Crome / albino GMS team comes into the scene. Gets a very annoying assistant who makes him want to shoot him for the first 3 minutes.","So I'm not a big fan of Boll's work, but many aren't.I enjoyed his movie Postal (probably the only one).Boll apparently purchased the right to use Far Cry long before the end of the game itself.<br /> <br /> Those who enjoyed the killing of Mark on a tropical island and infiltrating a secret lab should warn that this is not Far Cry... this is Mr. Bol.

Instead, we got some nice rich lumberjack trees.I've never been to FAR before I started crying (Mehehe) I can't go any further.If you want to stay true to Bolls Shennangan, don't be disappointed to watch this movie and offer a true Boll experience.

"Some movies simply shouldn't be remade. This is one of them. It is not a bad movie in itself. However, in 1963 with the same title, the taste and fear of the film were not captured. Liam Neeson was as good as it always was, except for Owen Wilson, who didn't feel right about Luke's character, and most of the cast supported. However, the main drawback of this version is that it was so far from Shirley Jackson's story that it made a magnificent attempt, and some of the thrills of the early films were out of balance with terrible special effects.

"Terrible movie! The nomination for the Golden Globe would have been against some real stickers. They took the story of the first famous female Renaissance painter and messed it up beyond recognition. My complaint is not that they are free of facts.

Why did they come up with this dull script? In fact, I assume there aren't enough naked people in the version. I ended up in a hurry with a summary of the artist's life.

"It's no surprise that Die Hard's success and sequel to the movie'Die Hard on a .....' in the 1990s is full of wrong people, wrong places and wrong time concepts.

He is an expert in climbing, bass jumping, aviation, facial expressions, and acting skills. It's usually full of excuses for dismissing a movie with a pile of exaggerated garbage.

And if you're looking for Kauren, he's wearing a helicopter."
". There was a terrible misfortune to watch this ""b-movie"" as a whole <br /> <br /> What I have to say-is to save time and money !!! This should be the worst b-movie ever, not even a b-movie like f-movie! Making a good movie fails in all respects, so the story is not at all interesting, and all the actors are almost fun because the paper is thin and unbelievable at all, the direction is wrong and the action sequence is so fake. ..... almost. <br /> <br /> This film is full of wacky one-liners that eminent people can't find fun. <br /> <br /> This film is aimed at men, but not all women in it are too attractive.

This has to be the worst b movie ever . Like f-movies, they shouldn't be called b-movies. The story isn't all that funny, and all the actors are paper-thin and totally unbelievable, because they fail on every side of making a good movie. direction is bad and the action sequence is very strange......Mostly.<br /> <br /> This movie is just full of fine one-liner.

"First of all, let's take a look at some of them straight here. A) I am an animation fan. It's always true (I've always seen SpeedRacer in kindergarten). B) I like several B-Movies because it is fun. C) I like Godzilla movies. <br /> <br /> When the movie first appeared on the move, it seems to be an ordinary B movie. Suddenly boom! Animation comes up! This is when the movie went downhill on WWWAAAAAYYYYY. <br /> <br /> Animation is very bad and cheaper than remembered in SPEED RACER. In fact, it's so cheap that one of the few scenes in the movie that I remember ""live"" is when a lot of kids run out of school. FX is also terrible. Dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. Also, the transition to live action to animation was not organized, the conversations and voices (especially the English dubbing I saw) were scary and begged my dad to take the tape out of the DVD/VHS player. The only thing I survived is to share jokes and opinions like the robots and Joel/Mike from MST3K (you choose the season). Honestly, this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie and survive at the same time. <br /> <br /> Heck, I plan to show this to other otaku friends on Halloween. Movie night. Stupid gypsum, too painful to look at, and unintentionally fun, gave this movie 3/10. Originally improved from 0.5/10 <br /> <br /> (According to my grading scale:.. 3/10 means boredom and bad. Unless you find a way to make it fun, counting to 3 is fun until 15. It's fun.)","First of all, let me explain a few things here: a) I'm a fan of anime-as always, I've been watching Speed ​​​Racer in kindergarten all the time).b) I like hilarious B-Movies. c) I love Godzilla movies.<br /> <br /> Going forward, when the movie first appeared, it seems to be your usual B movie and a crappy FX, but it's all suddenly booming!

"This was the worst movie I've ever seen at WorldFest, and has received the least applause ever since! You may think that you are getting such recognition depending on the number of actors known in the movie. It's nice to see J.Beals, but I'm in the movies for only a few minutes. M.Parker is a much better actress than allowed. The rest of the acting is difficult to judge because the film is so stubborn and predictable. Look at the protagonist because he is completely unsympathetic. There is no real emotional depth in the story. Movies about actors who cannot work are not original to me. Nor is the development of the police. It feels like a lot of direct video videos I saw in the 90s. And not good for that standard. <br /> <br />","It's the worst movie I've seen on WorldFest, with minimal applause.

"""Cell"" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying journey as one of the very talented directors as well as the massive spirit of serial killers. This is the definitive evidence that human beings can use their infinite imagination. This is boldness at work, putting thoughts into formal and cliché thoughts and making something truly cool. This is the best movie ever. <br /> <br /> Regardless of all movie styles, I've read numerous complaints about this film, and there's no material that can mis-characterize and act. To criticize this film negatively is to miss the point. This film may be a landmark, a tradition that future films hopefully follow. ""Cell"" has just opened the door to another imaginary world. So can we twist the face to the door and tell director Tarsem Singh that he no longer wants it? Personally, I want to see someone trying to challenge him more than welcoming other Tarsem films. <br /> <br /> I heard you talking about getting into the mind of a serial killer. I agree that the ""genre"" is a bit overkill. The 90s were full of movies depicting the serial killer's ticks. Some of them worked, but most failed. But ""cells"" do not break the same path, we feel a new twist, we are physically transferred to the mind, and present a fascinating journey of the most mysterious themes studied so far. <br /> <br /> I like the way movies don't spoil us with too much scientific jargon to explain how Jennifer Lopez actually gets into the brains of others. Instead, she just lay on the lab table and is actually wrapped in something that looks like long Twizzlers, plunging into another entity. ""Cell"" is intended to allow you to ""see"" ""what is everything"", not about what it is. I think that some people hate it. In fact, I like the description of the movie, but when the movie goes on an adventure to a new ground, you have to do what it wants and simply accept it. It showed reality, and perhaps contrasts bright images when inside someone else's brain. Nevertheless, the set design is simply amazing. You won't be surprised if this film took some Oscars from filming, best costumes, best directors, and more. If it is up to me, at least it will be named for the best picture. <br /> <br /> I knew that I was repeating myself. Not because I have nothing to say, but because I can't emphasize enough how fantastic ""The Cell"" was. You can have a great time by entering the movie with a very open mind and taking it to the feast of wonder and gaze. I wrote ""Strange"" or ""Crazy"" because this movie was too much for some people. I was so much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind that I was right under my alley. As I left the theater, I heard an audience say, ""Everyone who made a movie ate a lot of good medicine."" Then you want to smoke. <br /> <br /> **** (out of 4)","""The Cell"" is an exotic masterpiece, not only for the vast spirit of serial killer, but also for the dizziness of one of the very talented directors.This is the definitive proof that what humans can achieve if they unleash their unrestrained imagination.This is a daunting task, throwing away thoughts and falling into formulas and clichés to create something truly amazing.This is the best movie ever.<br /> <br /> I've read a lot of frustrations about the film, including all styles , inanimate characters, and poor acting.Negative criticism of this movie is missing the point.This movie may be a breakthrough. Hopefully future movies will be a tradition. ""The Cell"" has opened the door to another world of imagination. So hit the door from the front and tell the door and its director Tarsemsin that you don't need it anymore? Personally, I would like to see someone try to challenge him, rather than welcome another Tarsem movie.<br /> <br /> We all heard stories that went into the minds o f serial murderers.I agree that the ""genre"" is a bit overworked.The 90s were full of movies that tried to portray what a serial killer would do.Some worked, but most failed.But ""The Cell"" doesn't pave the way. Given a new twist, carried physically into the mind, it's just the fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject studied to date.<br /> <br /> I like that the movie doesn't bother us because there are too many scientific terms trying to explain how Jennifer Lopez actually gets into another brain. Instead, she lays down on a lab table, wrapped in something that looks like a really long Twizzler, and presented to another entity. ""The Cell"" wants to be able to ""see"" what it is, but wants to see how it's not ""how"". Sure, I like the description of my film, but when the film breaks into new territory, I have to let it do what I want and simply incorporate it .<br /> <br /> I noticed when the movie was very dark and showed reality to contrast bright visuals when inside another brain.Although, the design of the set was simply amazing.I wouldn't be surprised if this movie brought back some Oscars with cinematography, best outfits, best directors, etc.If it's up to me, at least you'll be nominated for the best photo.<br /> <br /> I found myself repeating myself.Not because I say nothing else, but because I can't fully stress how great ""The Cell"" was. You are convinced of a good time as you step into the movie with a very open mind and take it over with a mysterious and spectacular feast.The movie says ""strange"" or ""crazy"" and I think it's a bit too much for some people. It was just below my alley because I am very interested in psychology and the imagination of the human mind.When I left the theater, I heard one of the viewers of a movie saying, ""It certainly made a lot of good medicine.""

"'War Movies' is a Hollywood genre, and after a lot of conversations again, it seems that the conversations can be resumed, plotted and the best action sequences inevitable. But sometimes war movies come out, fight against the grain, and vividly tell the story of a truly original and fascinating story on a silver screen. ""Cold Mountain"" from the Civil War era starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renée Zellweger is such a movie. <br /> <br /> Then again, a war movie called Cold Mountain is not entirely accurate. The film begins with a (literally) fast and neat battle sequence that evokes the shame of ""Glory"" director Edward Zwick, but ""Cold Mountain"" is not about the civil war itself about the times and people. The story revolves around Inman, a dissatisfied Confederate soldier played by Jude Law. The Jewish War is disgusted by the horrific war and homesickness of the beautiful little town of Cold Mountain in North Carolina and the equally beautiful southern beauty Ada monroe he left behind. At first glance, romantic interest is officially seen when the audience gives compassion to take root in the tribulation of a reluctant soldier on the battlefield. In fact, the early part of the movie is relatively unimpressive and so impressive. <br /> <br /> ""Cold Mountain"" is undergoing a rapid change as soon as the bold hero Inman turns out to be a fugitive. Confederate) and a long Odyssey home. Meanwhile, back on the farm, Ada's educated method has proven to be rarely used in the field. Soon she turns into something of a beast. Like the nails played by Renée Zellweger, the demanding Ruby Thewes begins Ada's rescue, where Ada rebuilds the farm, and more importantly, to deal with the loneliness and isolation the war brought to Ada. It helps. <br /> <br /> In these two settings, South Korea looks vivid, intense and sometimes very confused by the war. The characters that Inman and Ada interact with are incredibly complex due to the amazing performances of Ruby's deadbeat father Brendan Gleeson, the unrepentant southern ""court"" Ray Winstone, and Natalie Portman, an isolated young mother in trouble. . Everything was greatly influenced and changed by the ""Northern War of Invasion"". Highlighted in Virginia and North Carolina's effective, unforgettable scores and relentlessly beautiful shots, the dark and widespread anti-war message is delivered to the audience through horrific battle scenes such as the wounds and wounds of the war. Fought. In the last century, the weapons and tactics of the war itself have changed a lot, but the impact of hell on the land is eternally relevant. <br /> <br /> Director Anthony Minghella maintains a gloomy mood for most films. Unfortunately, the atmosphere is neglected by the amazingly formed climax. Inman and Ada's love story is awkwardly attached to the beginning and end of the film, but the inherently distant, abstract and even absurd nature of the relationship fits the gloomy character of the rest of the plot. <br /> <br /> Actually, ""Cold Mountain"" doesn't have the characteristics of a pleasant romance or an inspiring war drama. It's not only interesting, but it truly absorbs greens into the lives of desperate people to completely get rid of the torn and completely terrible repercussions of war.","The War film is a Hollywood genre that has been repeated and redone, with subtle dialogue, rehashed plots, and over-the-top action sequences in any dispute dealing with massive battles.It seems inevitable.But from time to time, war films come out, countering grain and breathing a truly original and compelling story into the silver screen.

It is based on (Richard Brooks' brick fox hole) handling a homosexual murder case. But in 1947, homosexuality was still on the other side of pale.

The print quality is excellent, but this alone hides the fact that the film is deadly.

"One of the most important quotes from the entire film is half-pronounced by the mafia middle-aged man Titta Di Girolamo, a physically unexplained middle-aged man from Salerno, southern Italy. When we were introduced to him at the beginning of the film, he had been doing business gradually introduced during the past decade, living in an elegant yet sterile hotel in the Swiss-speaking Canton, Swiss speaking Italian. Di Girolamo's Cash Bank of Switzerland employees, who usually count, say that this pivotal but inconspicuous scene has occurred, but that $10,000 has been lost from an ordinary bag full of bills. In the news, he threatened a quiet but noisy bank account manager wanting to close his account. Meanwhile, he tells the crowd that when we bluff, we must bluff to the end without fear of being caught or ridiculous. Telling the truth that you can't be bluffing for a while, it's about half bluffing that you've done this in the end. Being told the truth, accepting the consequences of life and ultimately love is the reason that Titta Di Girolamo's difficulties began. <br /> <br /> This is initially a compassionate personality, growl, tacky turn, Kurt Man, 50-year-old man, and even those who say goodbye and say goodbye and don't kindly answer A person will be at one point Someone with a deep interest in the crowd. At one point in life, Titta decides to feel concerned about what seems to be ""funny."" The first half of the film can be described as ""slow"" by some. It actually reveals the day and night of Di Girolamo at the hotel at odd and crude speeds, showing ordinary and unrelated details. But the scenes that may have seemed superfluous show how essential this film is as it is creatively produced and innovative films unfold before your eyes. The presence of Titta Di Girolamo-a person without imagination, identity or life, a cold personality that unexpectedly makes you feel and love when you don't think-elegantly edited sequences and very interesting music use (one) The theme of the Scottish Band Council Especially noticeable). <br /> <br /> Since Hollywood and Italy have released movies like Le Conseguenze dell'Amore and L'Imbalsamatore, there has never been a contrast between the way Hollywood and Italy deal with mobs. Another interesting factor was the way the film used the protagonist's insomnia.

Although not explicitly stated, the spectators know that accepting the results of love for someone like Titta will have unimaginable results. A film without scenes of sex or violence, unregarded by the expectations of the audience unfolding in its own right, Le Conseguenze dell'Amore is a great figure representing a small, quiet and cautious Renaissance. Italian film after the decline of Cinecittà in the late 70's. The world is waiting for Italy to produce more La Postita style movies at the same rate as Il Postino. Don't explore great works like Le Conseguenze dell'Amore, L'Imbalsam atore and others. Your loss, world.","One of the most important quotations from the whole film is half-pronounced by the mafia middle-aged man Titta di Girolamo, a physically unexplained middle-aged man from Salerno, mainly in southern Italy.When introduced to him at the beginning of the film , he has lived the last decade at an elegant, sterile hotel in Italian-speaking Canton, Switzerland...During this crucial but unobtrusive scene, a Swiss bank employee, who usually counts Gigirolamo's cash, lost $10,000 from his usual suitcase full of closely Stacked banknotes.I am saying.In the news, he quietly but calmly threatened his coaxial bank manager that he wanted to close his account.On the other hand, he tells us that when you bluff, you have to bluff to the end without being He says: You can't bluff for a while and you can't tell the truth along the way.Eventually this was done-bluffing on the way to tell the truth, the consequences of life, and finally accepting love-ju st the reason behind the beginning of the troubles of Titta di Hiroramo.<br /> <br /> The first is caring with no personality, yelling of 50 verge, reticent personality of the man, Hello door goodbye say maid and kindly man I do not want to even reply to the waitress, A person the audience cares about at some point.At some point in his life, Titta was worried about what appeared to be ""ridiculous."" Some people describe the first half of the movie as "" slow."" It certainly reveals the day and night of Di Girolamo at that hotel at a strangely purposeful, deliberate pace, revealing seemingly mediocre and extraneous details.But what might seem unnecessary, the scene reveals how important they are, as this beautifully constructed and innovative film unfolds in front of you.The existence of Titta Di Girolamo-an imagination, an identity, a lifeless man, a compassionate personality that unexpectedly fell in love-the feelings I felt when I hadn't thought of it-with an elegantly edited sequenc e and very Interesting music usage (1 Scottish Band Board of Canada theme was particularly prominent).<br /> <br /> The treatment of Hollywood and Italian gangsters has never been in sharp contrast to the release of films such as Le Conseguense del Amore and Lambalsamatore. Another interesting factor was how the movie took advantage of the protagonist's insomnia. Unlike machinists (or more specifically, the Alpacino movie ""Insomnia""), Le Conseguense del Amore uses this state to plunge into the depths of unconscious ambiguity, more It symbolizes deep emotional discomfort.Determine the cause (if any).<br /> <br /> A young and thoughtful hotel waitress Sophia (played by legendary Anna's granddaughter Olivia Magnani) and Titta's best friend, a memory of a man he hasn 't seen in 20 years.It provides a small window of life that accepts (for the first time provisionally) a glance. Although unspecified, spectators know that for men like Titta, embracing the consequences of love has unimagin able consequences.A movie with no sexual or violent scenes, a movie that unfolds in your own time, and nothing meets the expectations of the audience, Le Consegunze del Amore is a great representative of its little quiet, unobtrusive Renaissance...

"I saw this movie actually not expecting much. I got it with 5 movies. It was all terrible for people under 5 years of age. And you know I was right. They are all terrible. There are a few interesting things about this movie. (And a few are stretching.) Sometimes the camcorder looks great. The drummer is very similar to the drummer, well, the problem is that it's really boring. What I could just assume was an attempt to build up tension, a lot of things didn't happen and when I was completely bored (I fasted my thumb) button forward, ready to hit most of the movies, but went on.) Seriously looking band The lead singer is serious. coz they don't even mention half how much hell he is. He looked like a meerkat, all these things and I didn't even mention the murderer, and I wouldn't even go into it. Anyway, Star and London are the only reasons to see this and I have seen a lot of things except London because they weren't really talented except London. Worse, I also saw much better. It's best to avoid it if you see the paint dry and don't get bored.","I didn't expect this movie so much so I got it in a pack of 5 movies.All of them were pretty terrible under the age of 5 in their own way, so what can you expect?

"This movie was bought at Blockbuster for $3.00. Because it was interesting because there was a cute girl in a little skirt behind (somewhat Ranma-esque with the thought that someone was dragging a skull). There is a limited viewing sticker. I thought it would be a sweet or at least serious story with a strange indie edge. I am 100% wrong. <br /> <br /> When I watched it, I wonder how it got a limited sticker because it's stupid language, less violence, and few things closest to nudity. When the girl is wearing pajamas and seeing panties (you can see a lot of panties in this movie, whatever, because she is wearing some kind of mini skirt). Even anti-religious humor is not tamed. TV show ""). This is not recognized as PG-13 (not rated), but the blockbuster refuses to rent it like someone under the age of 17 does porn. Any child can go there and edit the Requiem version edited for a dream I was able to borrow it, but Jack and Leba insisted it was worse.<br /> <br /> But it is not.<br /> <br /> This is how I'm worried. The only thing that can upset people is At first, the idea of ​​suicide is that honestly portrayed suicide movies (and not those like virgin suicide) are teenagers.If both movies were rated purely R due to the suicide aspect, then I would like to write a story about PG -There is very little chance to switch to 13 movies (the main characters are 11, 1/2, and 12.) Suicide is one of the three major causes of teenage adolescent deaths (I think it's number 2). 2/10. 2nd.","I bought this movie for $3.00 on Blockbuster.It seemed funny (the idea that someone was pulling around the skeleton made me feel a bit rough).There is a cute girl in a miniskirt behind, and a limited display sticker on it.I thought it would be a weird indie-edge sweet, or at least a sincere adult story.I was 100% wrong.<br /> <br /> Looking at this, I wonder why the restricted sticker was displayed.Few vicious words, little violence, and the closest thing to nudity (honestly, don't usually move in anticipation of it!) is when the girl is in a nightie and sees panties (Panties are often seen in this movie, because she wears some kind of miniskirt) .Even anti-religious humor is tame (and lame, satire, dishonesty, derivative, ingenious, and, at worst, not the worst) Ray Stevens' ""Would Jesus Wear a Rolex on His TV Show"" ). Although this is barely considered PG-13 (which has not been rated), Blockbuster refuses to allow anyone under the age of 17 to rent it like pornography.Any lit tle child can go there and rent the edited version of Dream Dream Requiem, but claims that Zack and Leva are worse.<br /> <br /> That's right, but it's not.<br /> <br /> In a way , this worries me-the only thing that can offend people is the idea of ​​​the first suicide.If someone honestly needs to watch a movie depicting suicide (this isn't the case, it's a better one like The Virgin Suicides), It's a teenager.If both of these movies were rated R purely for their suicide aspect, there is little chance of turning my story into a PG-13 movie (the protagonists are 11 and a half and 12).Suicide is one of the top Three leading causes of death among teenagers (I think it is the second).As a result, most teens are or may be affected by suicide.<br /> <br /> Say no to this movie, but. 2/10."

"Sitting on this pile of feces, my husband and I were wondering if a computer program was actually the product of an experiment to see if we could make a movie. There was no list and it was official. But the American propaganda thrown at your face throughout the film proves it's human. Call it a conspiracy theorist. But the phrase ""we must steal the Declaration of Independence to protect it"" seems like a way to justify actions like the invasion of Iraq. Nicholas Cage said, ""Use the Declaration of Independence as a trading chip."" Hit me straight and my husband wondered if the entire cast took Valium before filming each scene.

"It had the cliché of this kind of movie, and there was no material. The plot was nowhere, and at the end of the movie, I felt like watching it. Production was good. However, the script and acting were B movie quality. The cast was not good because a mix of rugby and good actors. The good actors did not take their position and did not listen to others. <br /> <br /> This film is not worth writing more words, but I will speak more to meet the requirements of at least 10 lines.

"The film deals with the issue of ethnic relations between Asia and Caucasian originating from the personal experience of Chinese Eurasian Han based on the book Han Suyin's ""Great Plenty"". Its background and beautiful Hong Kong atmosphere make this love story unique and bold. <br /> <br /> Beyond that, the story is probably a stereotyped romance with memorable songs. I remember more than the movie itself. The beautiful Jennifer Jones is a mixed breed doctor during the emergence of communism in mainland China, showing a wonderful Oscar nomination. William Holden, a journalist dealing with torn war zones around the world, did not see him as having a romantic edge. Acting is top notch, and the chemistry between the two lovers gives a true moment of affection to the silvery screen, which can melt the hearts of romantically tilted people. <br /> <br /> Filmography actually leads to Hong Kong in the 50s, especially the hills overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments. The ending is a person who truly sheds tears.

"Of all the movies I've seen, the movie The Rage is still one of the worst. I was suffering from plot, direction of conversation, logic, continuity, and change.

(W = waste). <br /> <br /> For example, about 20 FBI and local lawyers surround the trailer home with a jeep wagon. There's a MA in the jeep and it's ""confusing"" why all the police are there. In a matter of seconds, an enormous firefight took place, and MA was murdered straight away. Police flew from the jeep as Gary and the company flew with them. The police fall like dominoes and a garryed jeep flies into a circle and doesn't fit into one bullet/pellet. MA is dead and Gary doesn't seem to have noticed that the man is tough. Not since the six gunners had 300 bullets, but actually there was a miracle.","Of all the movies I've seen, this is still one of the worst ""Rage"".

"I heard the good news about the ""state of grace"" and came in with an open mind. I thought ""The Army of God"" was fine, and I thought the Dutch had developed and matured into filmmakers. The movie began with a swaying act, and I thought ""maybe better."" Unfortunately, it never did. The painting begins with the introduction of two elders (Mormon missionaries), and the audience is likely to grow to know and care for them. Instead, the story is transformed into a very unfortunate series of unfortunate events that highlight the apparent disobedience of missionaries (almost undeniable, but rarely at the level depicted by the Dutch) and almost funny. <br /> <br /> The only successful film in the Netherlands is the successful alienation of the target audience. The Dutch cannot achieve more than angering his Mormon crowd by unrealistically and inaccurately describing the lives of Mormon missionaries. Movies never reflect reality. The mission is not the same as the Dutch show (it seems to have done a Mormon mission to prove this) and California's gang life sometimes includes a much clearer language than light vulgarity. <br /> <br /> Conclusion I'm assuming that you need to inspire your audience and inspire everyone to believe they can be forgiven. (c'mon, the whole mission of this elder's home is gathered, the mother and the girl stand) right next to it!) and cheese. Next Dutcher try to make a movie that SOMEONE can identify.","I was open to hearing good things about ""States of Grace"". I thought ""The Army of God"" was fine, and perhaps Dutcher thought he had progressed and matured as a filmmaker. The movie started with an erratic performance and I thought, "" well, maybe it will be better."" Unfortunately that didn't happen.The photo begins with introducing two elders (Mormon missionaries), and the audience seems to know them and grow up. Instead, the story degenerates into an extremely unlikely sequence of unhappy events that underscore explicit blatant disobedience by missionaries (which undoubtedly exists, but rarely at the level of Thatcher), making it almost laughable. Will be.<br /> <br /> Dutch only Success in this film is a successful marginalization of The target audience.Dutcher can only offend the Mormon audience primarily by portraying the life of the Mormon missionaries as unrealistic and inaccurate.Movies never reflect reality.The mission is different from what Dutcher shows (I also performed a Mormon mission that could prove this fact myself), and the life of a gangster in California involves clearer words than occasional mild vulgarity...<br /> <br /> Conclusion I think it was supposed to inspire them to touch the audience and believe that forgiveness is available to all, both were incredible (served, All missions gathered to see the elders going home, and mom and girl are standing next to each other!) and cheesy. Next time, Dutcher, try making a film that someone can identify."

"As a disclaimer, I've watched movies 5-6 times in the past 15 years and this week I've only seen musicals. This made it possible to judge a movie without being polluted by being in a musical or not (but polluting me when I saw the musical). With Kasey, I think her'dance for you' is one of the best parts of the movie and I think it's worth compared to the musical. In movies, dancers and songs are much better than musicals and 10 times larger casts (of course easier than in movies). Decorations, lighting, dancing and singing are also much better in the movies and should be expected and actually delivered. <br /> <br /> Songs common to musicals are better done in movies, new songs are very good songs, and the whole movie is a musical with little decoration. One bad thing about the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors and dubs the singer in the song part of some characters, but the dance is not perfect and the final product is more enjoyable than the musical.","As a disclaimer, I've seen this movie 5-6 times over the last 15 years, but this week I've only seen a musical.

Her ""Let me dance for you scene"" is one of the best part of the movie and I think it's a valuable addition compared to musicals. The dancers and singers of the movie are much better than not only musicals, but also casts that are at least 10 times larger (which is, of course, easier to do in the movie). The decorations, lighting, dances and songs were also much better in the movie, which should have been expected and were actually delivered. <br /> <br /> The songs that were in common with the musical did well in the movie, the new song is a pretty good song, the whole movie is especially a less decorated musical. One of the bad things about the movie is the obvious difference between what the actors are talking about and what part of the song of some characters is dubbed a singer, but their dance is impeccable and the end product Was more fun than the musical"

"The power and glory of Preston Sturges remained invisible to the public for almost 20 to 30 years until it reappeared on television in the late 1990s. Meanwhile, Pauline Kael's CITIZEN KANE BOOK was notorious because he suggested that the script of KANE's Herman Mankiewicz-Orson Welles was based on the script of Sturgis. As mentioned at the beginning of this article about movies on the IMDb website, Kael exaggerated her case. <br /> <br /> There are about six commentators covering the life of Charles Foster Kane. (Ralston-Henry Luce clone representative), Memoirs of Thatcher, Bernstein, Jed Leland, Susan Alexander Kane, Butler Raymond. Each has a different slope that reflects his thoughts, disappointments or hatred of Kane. Of course, when he tells each story of Kane, he reveals his own failure. This method also often repeats overlapping overlaps for the same event. <br /> <br /> This is not a situation of power and glory. Yes, like KANE, it's about legendary business leaders. Here, Spencer Tracy worked at the bottom as the most successful rail system leader in the country. However, there are only two narrators. These are Garner's right hand Henry (Ralph Morgan) and his wife (Sarah Padden). This limits the almost three-dimensional view you get from Garner's Kane. In the narration, Henry talks about respected and beloved bosses and friends. His wife is like a skeptical public voice. She sees only Henry's flaws. <br /> <br /> General example: Although Although he worked, Tom became more and more anti-working in the later years. Unions are troublemakers, and they're her snani hen, Henry explains Tom's confrontation with unions in a major strike and how he has had a negative impact on family life. However, Henry's wife reminds him of how Tom uses a scab and violence to end the strike (by blasting the headquarters of the coalition to kill many people). So we have two views on men, but one is pure white and one is pure black. <br /> <br /> I'm not knocking on the power and glory that doesn't replicate KANE's success (other movies from Orson Welles), but I know the story was presented enough to interest the end. And the tragedy of the world's two successes has been completely back home, thanks to the performances of Tracy and Colin Moore as their wife Sally. <br /> <br /> When getting married, Tom (some) wants to do well to give his wife and family the benefits he never had, but a big business success in America costs money. Tom is deeply involved in the operation of the rail empire (expanding and improving continuously). However, he takes him too far from home and he loses contact with Sally. And he also pays attention to the young woman, Eve Vinson, who became a mistress. When Sally learns of her unfaithful behavior, it destroys her. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Tom is completely shocked (he makes him a martyr to Henry's eyes). Eve marries Tom and presents her son, but Tom's son Tom Jr. (Philip Trent) turned out to be Eve's son. Tom, who discovered this incest, shoots himself. <br /> <br /> The film was not entirely successful. Actions are sometimes persuasive. But it makes the business look real (note the scene where Tom tells the board about the plan to buy his own small competitive train line and discusses the use of bonds to finance the plan). Sturg is from a rich background, so you can bring this type of detail. Overall, this is the first movie. There is no CITIZEN KANE, but I am interested in film lovers as an attempt at business realism through Depression America's social commentary.",プレストンスタージスの「パワーアンドザグローリー」は、1990年代後半に再登場し、テレビに登場するまで、20年か30年近く、一般の人々には見られませんでした。一方、ポーリーン・ケールのTHE CITIZEN KANE BOOKがハーマンマンキーウィッツ-ケーンのオーソンウェルズの脚本は、ここでのスタージスの脚本に基づいていると示唆していたので、それは悪評を得ました。 IMDbのWebサイトでこの映画のスレッドの冒頭で述べたように、ケールは彼女の主張を誇張しました。<br /> <br />チャールズフォスターケインの人生を順番に扱っている約6人のナレーター：ニュースリール（ラルストン-ヘンリールースのクローンを表す）、サッチャーの回顧録、バーンスタイン、ジェドリーランド、スーザンアレクサンダーケイン、執事のレイモンド。ケインにはそれぞれの人の傾斜があり、その人への信仰、失望、憎しみを反映しています。そしてもちろん、それぞれが自分のバージョンのケインのストーリーを語っているときに、自分の欠点も明らかにします。この方法は、同じインシデントの頻繁な重複した再告知にもつながります。<br /> <br />これは、パワーとグローリーの状況ではありません。はい、KANEのように、伝説のビジネスリーダーについてです。ここでは、トムガーナー（スペンサートレーシー）が、国で最も成功した鉄道システムの責任者になりました。しかし、ナレーターは2人しかいません-彼らはガーナーの右腕のヘンリー（ラルフモーガン）と彼の妻（サラパッデン）です。これは、ガーナーのケインの時に私たちが得るほぼ3次元のビューを制限します。ヘンリーは、ナレーションをするとき、尊敬し愛した上司と友人について話します。彼の妻は懐疑的な大衆の声のようです-彼女はヘンリーの欠陥だけを見ます。<br /> <br />典型的な例：彼は彼の道を上ったが、彼の晩年にはますます反労働者になります。組合はトラブルメーカーであり、彼は彼らの虐待によって減速することを気にしない。ヘンリーは、主要なストライキにおけるトムと北朝鮮との対決、およびそれが彼の家庭生活を損なうことにどう没頭したかについて説明します。しかし、ヘンリーの妻は、トムがどのようにかさぶたと暴力を使ってストライキを終わらせたかを思い出させます（どうやら北軍の本部を爆破し、多くの人々を殺害しました）。だから私たちは男性の2つのビューを持っていますが、1つは真っ白で、もう1つは真っ黒です。<br /> <br /> KANEの成功を複製しないために、私は実際にはTHE POWER AND THE GLORYをノックしていません（いくつかの映画は-すべてを含む-オーソンウェルズの他の映画の1つですが）、物語が最後まで興味を抱くのに十分なほど上映されていることを私は知っています。そして、妻のサリーとしてのトレーシーとコリーンムーアのパフォーマンスのおかげで、このペアの世界的な成功の悲劇は完全に持ち帰られました。<br /> <br />彼らが結婚するとき、トムはうまくやっていきたいと思っています（一部）。彼の妻とその家族に彼がこれまでになかった利益を与えるため。しかしアメリカでは、大きなビジネスの成功には代償が伴います。トムは鉄道帝国の運営に深く関わっています（彼はそれを拡大し、絶えず改善しています）。しかし、それは彼を家から離れすぎてしまい、彼はサリーとの連絡を失う。そして、愛人となる年下の女性であるイブ（ヘレンビンソン）にも気づきます。サリーが不誠実な振る舞いを知ったとき、サリーは彼女を破壊します。<br /> <br />同様に、トムも完全にショックを受けます（これにより、彼はヘンリーの目に殉教者になります）。イブはトムと結婚し、息子にプレゼントしますが、トムの息子トムジュニア（フィリップトレント）がイブの息子であることがわかりました。この近親相姦の寝取られを発見すると、トムは自分自身を撃ちます。<br /> <br />映画は完全な成功ではありません。それでもビジネスは現実味を帯びています（トムが取締役会に小さなライバルの列車を購入する計画について話し、計画に資金を供給するための債券の使用について話し合う場面に注意してください）。スタージスは裕福な背景から来たので、彼はこのタイプの詳細をもたらすことができました。だから、全体的には一流の映画です。おそらくシチズンケーンはありませんが、うつ病アメリカでの社会的解説を伴うビジネスのリアリズムの試みとして映画愛好家に関心があります。

"Returning to the 36th Chamber is one of the classic kung fu movies produced by Shaw in the 70s and 80s with the protagonist Gordon Liu, Hollywood's Spaghetti Western and Clint Eastwood.

Three acts summarizing the story of a martial arts film of that era. <br /> <br /> Act One sets the premise. Workers working in dye factories in small towns are not satisfied with their site and Manchurian gangsters have cut wages by 20%. They can't do much about their exploitation because they don't have skilled martial arts to compete against the bully and their boss. Initially, they had some success in impersonating the highly skilled Shaolin monk (one of the best comedy sequences), but their rouge was exposed when they impersonated too many times to push the limits of trust. <br /> <br /> Act Two shows the protagonist who wants to return to the mob. However, without real martial arts, he begins his journey to Shaolin Temple, trying to penetrate and learn martial arts in a cunning place. After a bizarre moment, he is finally accepted by the Abbey (the most prolific one), but he is disappointed with the teaching techniques of Miyagi's style in Karate Kid, but instead of painting a fence, he sets a foothold around the temple. . Nothing can hold back a good person, unconsciously develop strength and endurance and learn kung fu in an authentic way. <br /> <br /> Act 3 is where the fighting festival begins. The cheese sound effect provides maximum impact handling for each non-contact non-contact of the film. However, using wide-angle shots to emphasize sharpness and detail between sparring partners and slow motion to show stunts from different angles is a refreshing view of the fight scene. You can see that the fight speed is too slow with a slight break between moves, but if Yuen Wo Ping and his style are used in the commercial area in Hollywood, they will not make the fight scene the same as before! The screening repeats when we return to the 36th room on Monday.

About 20 minutes (about 60 minutes left) began to show weak fake hands, and viewers began to realize that they were coming in. Gordon Ericsson culminated too quickly.

As he explained in Extras, he wanted to create a REAL document and settled on a cheaper way to make a movie without funding. <br /> <br /> The premise of enjoying a secret life by posting yourself on a porn website was probably more interesting in 1997-98 when the film was made. Eriksen does a lot of tricky things like tricky'hosts', handheld cameras, zooms, rough blacks and whites. It evokes a sense of truth, but it doesn't work. The film is confusing and coercive, but ultimately it's the actor's faith and a terrible conversation that drops the film.","As someone already mentioned on this board, making a fake documentary is very difficult.

"NO SpoILERS !! <br /> <br /> Hitchcock's first successful American film, Rebecca, is a familiar theme from the early days of England, based on Daphne DuMarier's rich Gothic romance and conspiracy novels-wrong identity and spy activity. The booming film entertainment business began to turn into a paranoid and often disgusting thriller with wartime themes as World War II settled as a massive'war effort' of civilians building planes, weapons and other necessary militias. These thrillers often included a network of deceptive and skilled operators who are dazzling in the shadows of good citizens who obey the law. Knowing that the director is at home in this spy genre, producer Jack Skirball instructs Hitchcock to corrupt his own possessions, impede wartime, and forceless heroes to accidentally swirl and accidentally push them.

He meets a number of characters on his way to Utah and again to New York City, avoiding authorities who do not believe in his story. These memorable characters include a circus caravan filled with helpful'monsters' cars, and the popular billboard model, Priscilla Lane. Of course, in the land of Hitchcock, Patricia falls into her hijacker who has been kidnapped by the domestically disturbing Barry, adding to the romantic tension in the mix. <br /> <br /> In this good form for a picnic, Hitchcock forms a national network. Save the old lady, the average Joe, a respected businessman who doubles as a gun and explodes a bomb twice as much as a secret agent terrorist with criminals. It's a great plot that takes time to reach and peak in one of Hitchcock's more memorable finals. Find an incredible life like NYC attractions (all of them were recreated by Hollywood art directors due to war spot'No Fire on Public Spots'). Saboteur may not be the best-known movie in Hitchcock, but as a popular b-movie, it certainly has a solid, clever plot and, as usual, a great Hitchcock villain. In the second half of the movie, you need to find Hitchcock's cameo appearance outside the pharmacy.

"I saw a dresser I saw only once this evening about 12 years ago. <br /> <br /> It's not a ""big"" movie, and I'm not trying to make a big splash, but God, there's no word in the brilliance of both leads. Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are not surprising in this movie. <br /> <br /> Dresser is the story of an aged Shakespeare actor (Finney) and his dresser Norman (Courtenay), who was in charge of the production of the rear king during the Blitzkrieg of London during World War II. These are two people, each dependent on each other. The teacher is almost helpless without Norman's help to get on stage for the 227th Lear performance without Norman's help. Norman is fighting his life through homage. Without a teacher who needs him, he thinks he's nothing or himself. <br /> <br /> This is a character-oriented movie. The conspiracy is secondary to the character's interaction, so it must bring life to the highest level of actors. Finney, who is only 47 years old, is very old, very sick, gorgeous, and bullied, but you can fully trust him as a gorgeous stage actor. He plays his sound and acts even when fellow actors bow! And Courtenay is a multi-ethnic dresser, less persuasive, and sometimes has to act more as a mother than acting for an elderly employer. But employers are actually the wrong term. Although technically their relationship is between the employer and the employee, in most cases, the Norman couple does nothing like an old couple. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are other people in this movie. But there is no question that the true stars are amazing scripts from Finney, Courtenay and Ronald Harwood. That said, Eileen Atkins is the oldest stage manager Madge, not to mention that there are no other great performances. There is a wonderful scene where Sir and Madge talk about old desires, old regrets, and what happened in the past. <br /> <br /> I'm not talking lately, but Dresser is nominated for 5 Academy Awards: Selected for Finney and Courtenay's Best Actor Nominations, Best Picture, Best Director (Peter Yates) and Best Adapted Screenplay <br /> <br /> I remembered that this was a good movie, but I'm ready to be totally fascinated from start to finish Was not there.","I have seen a dresser tonight.I have only seen it 12 years ago.<br /> <br /> This isn't a ""big"" movie and I'm not trying to make a big splash, but god, the glow Of the two reeds leaves me barely worded.In this movie, Albert Finney and Tom Courtney are amazing.<br /> <br /> Dresser is the story of Barrett, a kind of old Shakespeare actor Sir (Finney) and his dresser Norman (Courtney)., Directed King Lear during the London air raid during World War II. These are two men, each dependent on the other.Sir is almost helpless with the help of Norman, cajoling, whistling, and bullying Norman to get on stage For his 227th rear performance.And Norman lives his life through Sir. Unless Sir needs him, I think he has nothing, or he does.<br /> <br /> This is a character-led movie.Plots are a secondary of character interaction, and therefore require the highest-level actors to achieve it.Only 47 years old, Finney is a very old, very sick, uncomfortable, and bullying, but perfectly believed To be a stunning stage actor. He hiss and smokes his fellow actors, even when they are taking their bows! And Courtney is as compelling as Minced's dresser, and he sometimes has to act more as a mother than as a clerk to his older employer However, employer is actually the wrong term.While technically their relationship is an employer-employee relationship, in most cases Sir and Norman do not behave as an elderly couple.<br /> <br /> Yes, there are others in the cast of this movie, but there is no doubt that the real star is a great script by Finney, Courtney, and Ronald Harwood.That's not to say that there aren't other great performances, most notably, Irene Atkins as the long-suffering stage manager Madge. There is a great scene where Sir and Madge talk about old desires, old regrets, and what happened.<br /> <br /> Lately, Dresser has been nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Actor Nominations, Best Images , Best Director (Peter Yates) for both Finney and Courtney. ), and th e best screenplay.<br /> <br /> I remember this was a good movie, but I wasn't ready to be completely captivated from start to finish.If you'd like to see some great acting examples and want to keep. you entertained all the while, I recommend visiting The Dresser."
"How did it go? What we're here is basically a solid and plausible premise and a decent and talented cast, but it's lost somewhere in the movie. Actually, it never went. There was some excitement when we found out that Angie wasn't actually pregnant, but I knew she was finally pregnant. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to the movie, was frightened, and his entire character wasn't as important to this movie, except to make it longer. I would have liked to see more interactions between the protagonists Kate and Angie. Perhaps you haven't tried a pure comedy, but unfortunately it may be a drama with comedy elements. I think it would have been very fun if the movie had done this, because both actresses could think of numerous scenarios that would have been rioting in their own way, quite interesting and sitting here.","What happened?

"I really like Salman Khan, so I was really disappointed when I watched this movie. It wasn't a lot of conspiracy and what they had wasn't very attractive. But Salman looked young and new in the movie, but the price of this DVD was worth it. Music wasn't bad, but it was pretty good. In general, the length of Indian film is more than 2-3 hours, but it was very short in Indian film. The American actress who played in the movie is from the television hit series Heroes, Ali Larter. Much was needed for her acting. But she looked good in the Indian dress she wore. Not all films were so many, and I hope Salman will do much better in his next film.

"I'm not sure why producers should trade in the name of a rather successful movie franchise, as the title suggests that it's a sequel to the first three movies.

I'm sure everyone who wanted to see it was ""post estimate"" ""to think they're looking at guardianship."" It is not a completely different film with a familiar name. And sorry... Kym Whitley is not funny, and couldn't hold a candle to late Robin Harris, Ketty Lester or DC Curry in the early film. Although Meagen Good and Mari Morrow are real visual transitions...

"The film worked with the most predictable storylines and shallow characters. The artist obviously bought a playbook called ""How to Make a Spatial Disaster Movie"" and followed it. In particular, the typical use of astronauts talking to loved ones in outer space, where a brave show against disaster, has been repeated over and over again. <br /> <br /> Max Q was written with the hope that producers would spend $50 million on this project. But judging by the latter part of the movie, which included numerous lame attempts at special effects, the producers had to pay $50,000. Emmy stopped me completely to learn that the movie was named ""Special Visual Effects."" <br /> <br /> I think that a small number of high school students who have passed the media research can have more reliable effects! <br /> <br /> And there are too many plots to mention. But I will choose one as an example. I am not a NASA expert anymore, but the operator connected to the shuttle simulator is very likely to suddenly maintain the power position in the control room when the program starts to shape the ship. Surely there will be someone who is more experienced in mission control, which the program director called, than the twenty-nine-year-old who has never been to the control room. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace of this film is the work of Bill Campbell. He is trying to save something from this script, the train wreck. <br /> <br /> This film scored 2 out of 10, and is based on Bill Campbell's above-average work. Save at a lower score.","The film worked with some of the most predictable storylines and shallow characters ever seen.The writer obviously bought a script called ""How to write a disaster film in space"" and played it one after another.

Certainly, Mission Control has someone who has the experience of being commissioned by the Program Director, rather than the 29-year-old who wasn't in the control room before.<br /> <br /> Bill Campbell's work is the only saving money in this movie.

"Caddyshack Two is a good movie in itself, but it compares to the original that can't be stacked. The Robert Stack is a terrible replacement for Ted Knight and Jackie Mason, but what's funny is that you can't compete with Rodney Danger Field. Ty Webb is fun and the only character in the original. Most of the other characters in the movie lack the punch of the original (e.g. Henry Wilcoxon), except for the hysterical lawyer Peter Blunt, played by Randy Quaid.

"It tries to be an epic adventure of the century. And with casts like Shô Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies, it's actually a perfect B adventure for all the time. It's actually a pretty fun and swashbuckling adventure that grabs attention even if it's flawed. It would have felt like the biggest movie for those who made it. Even if it was made in the 90s, there is no modern feeling. It has the feel of an old Errol Flynn movie. A big adventure movie is again a big thing in Hollywood, but I'm afraid that the feeling of that movie will never be like this old movie. On the other hand, it has a real feeling. You can't hate it. I think it is a decent adventure movie. And I really like the soundtrack. Damn, I want a theme song.","It tries to become a grand adventure of the century.

"Last Hard Men finds outlaw James Coburn making a long sentence out of the chain gang. He and his friends head from prison and safety to the Mexican border. Not because Covent has a mission of revenge. Bringing him and killing the peace officer in the process killed his woman. <br /> <br /> The peace officer is now a retired Charlton Heston. Coburn explained to his daughter Barbara Hershey, punching a hole in a shack and engaging in standoffs like Waco. His Indian woman died from bullet hail. Rather than being proud of him, she was the incidental casualty of Man Hunt. <br /> <br /> In order not to feel sorry for Coburn, he gives a complete picture of what the wicked man is. Heston is his ordinary hero, but Last Hard Men's acting fame goes to James Coburn. He blows another person off the screen when it is on. <br /> <br /> Coburn kidnaps Hershey and takes the white authorities to an Indian reservation where he can't touch him, and gets a bright idea for Heston to follow him. He knows Heston has to make it personal. <br /> <br /> Coburn's gang includes Morgan Paull, Thalmus Rasulala, John Quade, Larry Wilcox and Jorge Rivero. Heston is with his son-in-law Chris Mitchum. <br /> <br /> The last Hardman is an unpleasant and brutal Westerner. It was ordered by Andrew McLaglen and I think it will be originally a project for Sam Peckinpaugh. It has had a lot of influence in using slow motion freely to emphasize violence. There are many of them. <br /> <br /> For the little Peckinpaugh Wright, Last Hard Men is the movie.","Last Hardmen found James Coburn's long-written outlaws freeing him from the chain gang.

"Maybe it was a title or a trailer (perhaps not a DVD interview with the director saying ""hello"" to the camera like Buffalo), but I had anticipation for the maiden's entree. Have fun at least with a good sex scene and a brutal and bloody murder by a strange Japanese spit investment. It is too loose for your own benefit or bad or anything. There is a problem, and you can see this in Italian exploration movies, the porn holocaust. Porn holocaust is similar in many ways, but the balance between sex and violence is not. Too much sex and it will turn into prototype porn, and not even a lot of production quality compared to most professional porn movies! And in the murder scene, at least a little bit about creating a creature / killer / anything. There must be a tack and maybe originality of the virgin entree. It's safe to say it's a pretty soulless movie even if it's not the worst worst person. A mixed Japanese fetish list can be given to men in trouble and men who have the brains of others. In this case, we were given a photo team where men shot some women and were too celery, and through the thick fog he came home one night and was picked up one by one by ""murderer"". First of all, director Kazuo'Gaira' Komizu decides that an initial random sex scene should be assigned. We have access to one or more sex photographer's clips or phone calls to choose. Girls from elsewhere. It seems to be from another movie. After settling in the house, there is a'wrestling' scene with choreography and poor shooting (yes, we need to watch'everyone' for him). First, rape the girls who promise to rape the photographers. Then the killer who likes D'Amato's creatures is simply covered with mud and gives a silly face, killing men or raping women one by one for unknown reasons. <br /> <br /> Now, the latter must be considered the highlight of the film. But this is that croton is the biggest part of a miserable tasting salad. A soaring scene (actually a great scene) thrown like an Olympic event, and finally the temptation of a sexually enthusiastic girl, a name that I can't remember the result of. Even * this * is disappointing even if it doesn't fit the title! Also, the sex scenes that get bored through'Gaira' and the long-awaited addiction without cutouts where everything is blurred by Japanese censorship are dubbed by the actors (you seem to be enjoying yourself enough that they will think, but the virgins' Entrails The overall feeling of (Entrails of a Virgin) is a rugged feeling, where there will be no blockages of tension or true horror, stop the murderer from being caught by her while she throws a wand at him 5 Lasts for a minute!) You want the'I hate women' mantra to calm down or get rid of it entirely.","Maybe it's title or trailer ( ""Hello, children,"" certainly the camera as he is a clown is not a DVD of the interview which is in conjunction with the director because they kept saying), but I expect to Our Lady of the internal organs Have at least a little meanness with some good sex scenes and a brutal bloody killing by a weird Japanese penetrator. It turns out to be too lazy for its own good, evil, or whatever. There is a problem, which can also be seen in the Italian sexual exploitation flick porno Holocaust. This is in many ways the same as the fact that sex and violence are not balanced. If you have too much sex, it becomes prototype pornography and production quality is not that high compared to most professional pornographic movies! And in the murder scene, creating a creature/killer/anything requires at least a little ingenuity. The Virgin's internal organs have neither. It's safe to say that it's a pretty soulless movie, even if it's not one of the worst movies ever. The Horndog Japanese Fetishist is just there to get off to the girl in trouble and the man who has all the brains in others' heads. <br /> <br /> In this case, we are given a photo team where a man is taking some shots of some girls. Build a house overnight and be picked up one by one by the ""murderer"" as he is credited. First, director Kazuo'Gaira' Komizu determines that he needs to place quotas for random sex scenes early on-we are of photographers having more than one sex. Splice one clip (or call by phone) of the other girl. It's like another movie. Then, when you settle down at home, there is a ""wrestling"" scene shot with poor choreography (yes, we really have to see him ""everyone""), followed by rape and murder. First, the rape by the photographer promises a job to the girls. Then the murderer, who likes Damato's creatures, is simply covered in mud, given a silly face, killing men for unknown reasons or raping women one by one. <br /> <br /> Now, the self-shoot of the latter should be considered a highlight of the movie. But this is like saying that Croton is the best part of a miserable salad. A striking scene, a spike thrown like an Olympic event (the scene is actually a kind of cool stuff), and finally, I remember the visceral girls' guts. Even *this* is disappointing just because the title is incorrect! What's more, a sex scene that gets bored by ""Gaira"" and his indulgence in a long takeout with no cropping, which is all blurred by Japanese censors anyway, is dubbed by the actors (you'll enjoy them enough) It looks like you need to be able to ""speak"" yourself.) However, the overall feel of Entrails of the Virgin is rugged, it's just there without suspense and real horror shards (when the last girl survived, the virgin in the photo was murdered). Will stop her approaching her, lasting 5 minutes while she keeps throwing him a stick!), so that the mantra of ""I hate women"" can be relaxed or completely removed. You just want to finish it."

"Stephen Ho Kings is a genius. He is the king of genius. I feel stupid when I watch this movie. But it is a great movie. It's not fun, but it's very interesting.

"Oh God, I would have seen this when I was 11 or 12 years old. (Don't ask how) You may have been young, but it wasn't foolish. Anyone can watch bad movies, unpleasant, rough, rude and very stupid.

"""Fate"" allows Walter Sparrow to own a mysterious novel similar to his life based on number 23. As the story unfolds in real life and fiction, we need to find out the connection with the book and how the story will eventually end. <br /> <br /> Number 23 provides an interesting premise that does not end due to weak executions. The film has failed on many different levels, and it is disappointing because it has a lot of potential. The scenario is probably the worst part. It was full of silly sequences and laughter conversations that killed the mood of the movie. The screenwriter seemed to have a good idea, but I didn't know how to develop it to extend the run time over 90 minutes. In the second half of the film, the idea was lacking, the distortion was quite clear, and the ending was terrible. <br /> <br /> Joel Schumacher is in charge of one of the worst movies and has a phone booth and a few other movies, but the number 23 reminds him that he can still make a stinker. He's scratching the film, but he can't get a good focus. He moves the movie cool and slow. He quickly transitions from reality to books that are happening realistically. The actual book titled ""The Number 23"" in the movie is a terrible detective story, and the audience tears down as they listen to Carrey's story. When Carrie finally ends with a book, we are watching him try to solve the mystery. At this point, the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension. Waiting patiently for the movie to reach a terrible ending and an unconvincing explanation before celebrating the movie is finally over. <br /> <br /> Acting was mostly average and unforgettable. Jim Carrey apparently had sleepwalking through his performances, and it seems he hasn't even tried. He was either completely over in some scenes or very woody. His narration was a perfect bore to hear and did not put life in his character. Virginia Madsen did her best with limited roles, but you should pick a better script. Logan Lerman, like Danny Huston, is very soft. Overall, number 23 was a terrible thriller that gives more laughter than tension or thrill and sword 3","""Destiny"" led Walter Sparrow to a mysterious novel with mysterious similarities and connections to his life.All based on 23. Sparrow needs to understand his connection to the book because the story unfolds in real life and fiction<br /> <br /> Number 23 provides an interesting premise that has been canceled by a weak execution.I will. I was quite disappointed because the film had just failed on many different levels and had huge potential.The script was probably the worst part about it.It was full of silly sequences and funny conversations that killed the mood of the movie.The writer seemed to have a good idea, but didn't know how to develop it to stretch it to a 90 minute run time.The second half of the film was lacking in ideas, the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful.<br /> <br /> Joel Schumacher is in charge of one of the worst movies ever, he's a phone booth and several other films, but the number 23 says he can still make a stink.Remind me He has a film soak ed in style, but he just can't get a good focus.He moves the movie at a clumsy and slow pace.He switches from reality to what quickly becomes annoying what is really happening in the book.The actual book in the movie titled ""Number 23"" is a dreadful detective story, and the audience was stuck hearing Carrie's narration, which bored me with tears.When Carry finally finishes writing the book, when he sees him running around to solve the mystery, he gets stuck.At this Before finally celebrating the completion of the film, we wait for it to reach a compelling explanation with its terrifying endings. Jim Carrey was obviously just sleepwalking his performance, and it didn' point, the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension. He seem completely he on trying.He was completely up on some occasions or very wooden.His narration was completely boring to listen to, and he didn't give life to his character.Virginia Madsen did his best in a limited role, but she needs to pick a better script. Logan Rahman was as calm as Danny Houston. Overall, number 23 was a horrifying thriller that provided more laughter than suspense or thrills. Rating 3/10"

"This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life!! It was foolish that there was no plot. And the special influence was silly!! And I have never seen such a bad behavior in my life! The only good part about the movie was all the hot guys (especially Drew Fuller). I don't know what these people were thinking when making this movie!! You didn't want to end it all because you reached this point in a movie where all the boys are lying in bed. I mean it was kind of sick and kinky kiddy porn!

"This is a typical Steele novel in that two people who have experienced some kind of tragedy can do it together despite the odds. I'm not going to call this a spoiler because everyone who reads the Steele novel knows how they will end up. Read on if you don't want to know much about the plot. <br /> <br /> Gilbert's character Ophelia is a French woman who lost her husband and son in an accident. Gilbert needs to quit the movie where the accent should be. Otherwise, a good actress cannot realistically pick up any kind of accent. Brad Johnson, who is also an actor, is recovering from a rather unpleasant divorce. He is gentle, persuasive, and persuasive in this role. <br /> <br /> The two met on the beach through their daughter Pip, and at first Ophelia accused Matt of being a child molester because she talked about art with her children. After this episode, they all become friends and couples. Fall in love. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between the two leads is not great, although the talent of these two is not in my opinion. Question. They did their best with predictable plots and stereotyped scripts. A tragedy, a greater tragedy, and a secret came together, and another tragedy arose. I wish there were more than that. But it is simple. <br /> <br /> I wanted entertainment without mind, and I got it with this. Regarding the genre of romantic movies, this is unforgettable. Janine Turner's ""Secret Case"" is much better than some of Steele's early books turned into movies (not Steele's).","This is a typical Steele novel production where two people who have experienced some sort of tragedy get together despite the odds.

"The Hollywood film industry is the most lazy industry in the world. It only takes a single blow to the Flood Theater, where the same old trash continues to be invented again. For example, Superman, for example, Daredevil, Elektra, Ghost Rider and Hulk for X-Man and Spiderman. Japanese horror remakes are the worst. Only The Ring, which was pitch perfect (thanks to The Gore Verbinsky), brought in a horrifying, female-based fear that looked similar. Ring 2, eyes, dark water (fine but meaningless), and grudge. <br /> <br /> The first grudge was not entirely bad. It was scary in most ways. In addition, the plot has a brain that mixes stories.

"Deanna Durbin, Nan Gray, and Barbara Read introduce Deanna Durbin to the movie audience as ""Three Smart Girls"" in this universal film in 1936. Also starring Ray Milland, Mischa Auer, Charles Winninger, John King, Binnie Barnes and Alice Brady. It's a story about three young women who live in Switzerland with their divorced mother and hear that their father (Winner) is getting married again. After 10 years of not seeing him and knowing that his mother still loves him, they boarded the United States, who decided to stop the wedding with the help of a maid/nanny. Realizing that the intention of ""Barnes"" is nothing more than a gold seller with the help of his mother (Brady), she introduces her to the wealthy Count. This is arranged by my father's accountant (King). The person he chose is full-time drinking (Auer), but the girls mistake him for real wealth (Milland). This is a mess. <br /> <br /> This film is a delightful film that is not particularly cloning or overly hard with great performances by Auer, Milland, Barnes and Brady. Young women are pretty and they all do good. Of course, the focus is on the young Durbin, a natural actress and a beautifully trained singer. In fact, the voice of a child is much higher than that of an adult. She puts too much weight on the middle sound, so there's no problem with the high notes like it did later. She sings a delightful ""Il Bacio"" at the police station. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about the movie is seeing the father Charles Winning played. You will know them. Barnes, the gold seller, is not very young, but the girl's mother goes up there, so perhaps an older man is looking for a younger, more attractive woman and his youth. In fact, he found a young man looking for his daughters. <br /> <br /> Universal makes Durbin a big star. She has the last scene from the movie. At this point, Ray Milland was still paying his dues, and even filming how young and attractive he was to fans would be surprising. <br /> <br /> Star for Deanna.","Diana Durbin, Nan Gray, and Barbara Reid show Diana Durbin to the viewers of the movie in this 1936 Universal Movie Three Smart Girls.Also starring Reimi Land, Mischauer, Charles Winninger, John King, Vinnie Burns and Alice Brady.

"People who are wondering why no one is making a movie like people who are struggling to evolve into something new, better and different with new topics of conversation, character and friendship should take part in this movie and dictate the highest level of writing. And that action leads to a good evening observation of the Italian and British situation.

"I think this will be more than two parts originally, so it will be at least a quarter longer. Otherwise, how can you explain the confusing and abbreviated plot. I've never lost it completely, but I've often lost it partially, and usually I'm not clear about personality motives. The movie feels like the combined plot points have been deleted to connect to the time slot. <br /> <br /> A longer length makes more sense, but still not good.

"Well, I want to see a bad horror B-movie. I think it's fun to see filmmakers being stupidly incapable of filming seriously good movies.

But people! !! ""Chilling"" is not fun and it is not ""interesting"". It is a horror movie with nothing to make even a bad movie visible.

"I was a Mario fan I can remember. I love the memories of playing Super Mario World as a child. This game regained a lot of memories while adding new ones. Super Mario Galaxy is the latest addition to the amazing Mario franchise. There is something very different about this game from other Mario about this game while keeping the biggest element of Mario intact. The first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in space. <br /> <br /> Like other Mario games, Mario receives a letter from the Peach Princess and invites him to a celebration party in the Castle of the Mushroom Kingdom. Upon arriving at Peach Castle, Mario attacks Bowser and his son (Bowser Jr.) with an airship. Bowser kidnaps the Peach Princess and then lifts her castle into space. In the middle of the castle being lifted into space, Mario falls and lands on an unknown planet. Mario is discovered by a talking star named Luma and returns to Luma's house, a floating space station. Mario meets many other Luma and meets their leader Rosalina. Rosalina says Bowser was scattered in space by taking the space station's Power Stars. It's up to Mario to help Luma find Luma and save the peaches. So the adventure begins. <br /> <br /> This is a game of flying from space station to another galaxy. Each galaxy searches for power stars by moving through Mario Guys to different levels. Mario can move around the planet multiple times without losing gravity, some planets are small, others are big, and many are similar to the classic Mario environment. The best thing about the game is control, everything like jumps is still the same, but wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game. When you shake the remote Mario, the spin used as the main attack in the game is performed and the shooting star is also activated. You can also point the remote control at the screen and use the pointer to fire a star-shaped bit at an enemy or object in the environment. Then there is the graphic. These are the best graphics on Wii. It will be too hard to describe how cool this game is. Perhaps you can say that it looks as good as a 360 game. <br /> <br /> My only minor grip is that the inverted effect takes some time to get used to and the story is very weak. The worst part is that how many people lose all their lives when turning off the game when they restart 4 when they last exit. Nevertheless, these minor problems are great games that are very fun and very difficult. This is the type of game you are waiting for on Wii. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 perfect!","I was a Mario fan, but as far as I remember, I really liked playing Super Mario World as a kid.The game has regained many of those memories while adding something new.Super Mario Galaxy is the latest addition to the amazing Mario Franchise.

"Inspired by the upcoming feature film, Spatula Madness, this short film is a fun piece to confront with similar cartoons that produce several cartoons. Short film star Edward Spatula takes part in a fight against the evil spoon after being fired from work. This premise allows for interesting content from the beginning, but rarely exists in the rest of the features. The film's 15-minute running time is absorbed by odd ball comedies and small sheet music. Unfortunately, there isn't that much under it. The set plot has no time to actually show. However, the plot is better than many Hollywood movies. This movie is worth watching at least a few times. Take it for it, don't expect a deep story.","Inspired by the soon-to-be full-length feature-Spatula Madness-this short film is a hilarious fight against a similar manga that spawns multiple writers. The star of the short film is Edward Zahera, who takes part in the battle with the evil Spoon after being fired from work.

"Last night, on August 18, 2004, as part of the Chicago Underground Festival, I expressed a clear dissatisfaction with meeting Van Bobble, who showed the movie'The Manson Family' at the 3rd Penny in Chicago. Here is what I have to say. First of all, this film is clearly torn from all the Kenneth Fury I've seen, Roman Polanski, Oliver Stone, and Terry Gilliam movies. Second, in a short Q&A session after the show, Van Bebble immediately stated that he did not contact the actual Manson Family member or Charlie himself and called him a liar and did not say that he had nothing to do with them. The film was based on his (Van Bebble's) film on trial, which he saw everything in his living room on TV and news (and assumes from the book Helter Skelter imitated directly through autobiography and stories). So I had a second dip in the question, and whether he tried to present outsiders, Mtv, sex drugs and rock and roll versions is not necessarily a real story. The question is ""f *** shut up, shut up, this is true!"" Anyway, I didn't even think how funny this was until I read the movie's tagline the next day. ""You've heard the law side of the story.. I've heard it now. ""Excuse me by the Manson family."" Excuse me. What if this guy thinks they're liars they don't want to care about because they've never told the family? Can you tell me in God's name!?This is the funniest thing I have ever heard!The movie was clearly provided to the sex drug and rock and roll audience so there was no problem turning off the small, dim light and the sex drug and rock and roll spirit It was even clearer by the time that he couldn't watch his movie without going up every 10 minutes to go for more beer or to shout some sort of Rocky Horroresque callline to the actors on the screen. Nothing more than transforming an image (today helped form the United States and other countries around the world) into a kind of slasher / comic book / porn / rape fantasy that an apparently shallow individual dreams of. br /> <br /> The movie It was really impressive, the soundtrack was refreshing with a sample of Charlie's family work in the Lie album, and the editing was great and uneven to simulate the nausea uncertainty of most modern music videos, all of which were Mtv more than underground film festivals It would have been better added to the catalog or captured the minds of the intellectuals, and at midnight I felt like Rocky Horror was watching the way the audience dressed and behaved (probably the best part of the experience).

"I bought this game as an impulse purchase from Walmart. Glad to hear Sean Connery's words and play the game. I thought the graphics I saw in the movie/game remake were the best.

"No, this horrible horror clinker for TV in this terrible 70s is not a deadly evil dessert cake. Nevertheless, this terrible, but undeniably fun and enjoyable cathode ray trash has reached the breathtaking peak of absolute and constant stupidity and horror.

Loosely portrays the suburban couple receiving. As family pets turn out to be ancient deadly evil spirits, the presence of a German shepherd tears them apart. Soon Mimieux and her two youthfully cute children, Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann (the mental alien shepherd in the Disney ""Witch Mountain"" painting), are worshiping the crude crayon drawings of unpleasant and ugly canine objects in the cave. Boy, isn't that sound really scary and confusing now? Well, I'm not sure about being scared and disturbing this ridiculous and silly applause, but it's really fun thanks to Curtis's (""Night Tide"") Harrington's desperately weak direction, comic-like (not) special effects, and almost painful and terrible terrible. .

When he takes over the director's chair, his ego grows. The focus is mostly on those, Spock and McCoy, but not enough for others. Also, Shatner is generally convicted of being overly acting in previous films and TVs, but he is clearly bad at this. Now Kirk is a reckless, practical joker and a fool.

"I liked Boyle's performance, but that is the only positive thing to say. Everything was overcome, even to the point of irrationality. Most actors said that you expect your nine-year-old nephew to speak like a desolate, stony policeman or a very malicious villain. A loud voice looked like an amateur. I could buy a cheap synthesizer and make better opening music. And what about police advisers, circa 1984? It was completely unnecessary and was not related to the actual event in the story. Cox actually thought he was really cool, but added a lot that had nothing to do with the story. One of the things that makes the story of Borges good is his disappointment, which is his minimalism.

"The challenge is an excellent thriller with a few plots driven by personality rather than the need for a star turn, special effects, mandatory romance and endless car chase. But here's the car chase and it's cool. Aidan Quinn is great because terrorists and naval officers ""recruited"" to get rid of him. It is unlikely that you will be given such an important role to play a movie to a second or third tier actor like Quinn. In general, these roles are given to A-list actors through the box office lottery, so you probably never heard of it before watching this movie. Donald Sutherland is an agent who hires queens, sometimes morally ambiguous and somewhat creepy. Ben Kingsley is also an Israeli agent. The plot is very complex, has multiple story lines, converges in a gradual way towards the end, and not all at once, as we are accustomed to. The paranoia and phobias of this type of thriller are captured and depicted with moral ambiguity and terrifying strength. The location is persuasive and effective.

"Started in 1794, the second year of the French Republic after the execution of Louis XVI, the film depicts a power struggle between revolutionary leaders Danton (the best Gerard Depardieu) and Robespierre (a performance conducted by Polish actor Wojciech). P. Johnny Ak). Moderate revolutionary Danton returned to Paris from his homeland after being appointed leader of the Public Safety Commission the previous year by Robes Pierre. He opposes ""terrorism rule,"" and thousands of citizens have been executed by guillotines who are thought to be opposed to the revolution. Danton is confident in the support of ordinary people and tries to persuade Robespierre to restrain his persuasion. But Robes Pierre and the Council are concerned that Danton's popularity will overturn it, and Van Turn and his supporters are tried for traitors. It is the first French movie made by Andrzej Wajda after arriving in Poland from France. His Polish film company was closed by the government in support of solidarity unions who opposed the Polish government in the late 70s and early 80s. His previous film, ""Man Of Iron"" (1981) featured solidarity unions and their leader Lech Walesa, and can easily compare the relationship between Walesa and Polish leader Jaruselski and the relationship between Danton and Robespierre. Danton/Walesa continues dictatorial rule despite losing support from those who claim to represent it in a voice of reason against Robespierre/Jaruselski. The film is based on the Polish play ""Danton Affair"" by Stanislawa Przybyszewska in the 1930s, and some of the film was criticized for being static and theatrical. But what the film does is focus on the scenes of the committee's behind-the-scenes meetings and parliament and courts, rather than on the streets of Paris.","It is the second year of the French Republic, set in 1794 and formed after the execution of Louis XVI. The film depicts a power struggle between the revolutionary leader Danton (Gerard Depardieu, his finest) and Robespierre, a conductor performance by Polish actor Wojciech. Psoniac). Moderate and revolutionary Dunton returned to Paris from his country seat. He was retired last year as leader of the Public Safety Commission by Robespierre. He opposes the ""rule of terror"" that led to the execution of thousands of civilians, mainly by guillotines, which are believed to oppose the revolution. Danton is confident in the support of the public and tries to convince Robespierre to curb bloodshed. However, Robespierre and the Commission fear that Danton's popularity could defeat them and have tried Danton and his supporters as traitors. This was the first French film after Anjay Weida arrived in France from Poland. His Polish film company was closed by the government in the late 70's and early 80's due to his support for the solidarity union, which opposed the Polish government. His earlier film, ""Man Of Iron"" (1981), deals with the solidarity union and its leader Lech Walesa, which makes it easy to compare the relationship between Walesa and Polish leader Jaruselski, and Danton and Robespierre. I will. Danton/Waressa is a voice of reason against Robespierre/Jalserski who has continued to have dictatorship despite losing the support of those who claim to represent them. The film is based on the Polish play ""Dunton Affair"" written by Stanislaw Příbyshevska in the 1930s, when the release criticized the film as static and theatrical.

"I have seen many movies by Pedro Almodóvar right now, but I am the most disappointed so far. The film generally seemed to lack the calmness that appears everywhere in his film, and the story was never interested.

Fortunately, the movie script fixes Atwood's clumsy plot by focusing on the story of the victims of two men and two women... <br /> <br /> Heh. Okay, if these guys are mentioned in the book and they're sure they're made for a movie, they'll eat a hardback copy of the dust cover. Obviously, the three main female characters in the novel are not enough to carry the movie. Zenia's manipulation is not interesting unless you see what happens to a person, and a person's life is ruined. Rose, Charis, and Tony tell their stories to men. Because it doesn't matter if a man doesn't listen. <br /> <br /> I liked the character in the book. It hurts to see them push sideways for a man's story. I usually try to enjoy the movie as it is without finding a feminist angle in the media. If I hadn't read the book, I would have enjoyed the movie much more. So, if you like the police and the former police and want to read more about them, no luck. If you want to enjoy the beautiful prose and traits subtly layered through the plot, read the novel. It is the same conspiracy. The movie unearthed it, ironed it, and sprinkled it with a man's anger. It's like Zenia's revenge against Margaret Atwood.","I enjoyed Margaret Atwood's novel ""The Robber Bride"" very much and I was very excited to see the movie version.A woman tailors a police boyfriend for her murder, and his buddy, a former police journalist, tries to find out the dead woman's crazy girlfriend and reveal his name.Luckily, the screenplay in this movie corrected Ms. Atwood's clumsy conspiracy. Okay, you got me.If these guys are mentioned in the book and I'm sure they're composed entirely for the movie, I eat hardcover copy dust covers. Apparently, the three main female characters in the novel are not enough to carry the movie.The operation of Zenia isn't fun unless it happens to a man and ruins his life.Roz, Charis, and Toni tell their story to a man.You don't have to hear the man.<br /> <br /> I liked the characters in the book.It's painful to see them pushed aside for a man's story.I didn't usually look for a feminist's point of view in the media, I just enjoyed the movie.If I hadn't read the book, I might have e njoyed the movie more.So if you like cops and ex-cops and want to read more about them, you're out of luck.If you want to enjoy the subtle layers of sweet prose and characterization through the plot, read the novel. It's the same plot: the movie unearthed it, ironed it, and spoiled the man's anxiety.It's like Zenia's revenge on Margaret Atwood."
"Interested in plot or acting, this film scored 10 points. I took video from another movie and added it to this movie. Because it wasn't important to me because I had never seen a movie he filmed. Goriest Italian Movie you will ever see.","There are a lot of gussets in this movie, so it will be 10. A person who cares about intrigue and acting.

In the horror hound collection, there is no machihound without this movie.Whatever your dream of horror, buy this movie."
"Ingrid Bergman, who plays the faithful guide of dentist Walter Matthau, who has a bit of a crush on the boss, is absolutely amazing in this film. She handles the witty talents in a talented script and steals the wonderful scenes she and Goldie Hawn talk in the record booth (Ingrid's monologue is frontal, but her face says she believes it with all her heart). Matthau is a strange choice for a leading person (it's too old for Goldie Hawn, not too refined for Bergman, and not too focused on being a dentist).I love working hard and trying freely to please Goldie . Lying in yourself. Hawn (the person who supports Oscar) is as fresh and bubbly as it is today.

She treats the witty opponent in the script courageously and steals the wonderful scene where she and Goldie Hawn are talking at the record booth (Ingrid's monologue is the front line, but her face is what I believe that). Matthew is a weird choice for top men (not to mention he's too dentist because he's too old for Goldie Horn and too sophisticated for Bergmann) ).

"The ""Zombie Rebellion"" proves that the same director is not necessarily thundering twice by improving and recycling ideas. <br /> <br /> Brother Harolin was responsible for the classic ""White Zombie"" of Horror. Just a few years later, to make trash popular, it was scrapped and recycled the eyes of Lugoshi in previous films. In a court battle with the copyright owner of the ""White Zombie"" movie, Halperins was preventing the use of the word'Zombie' in this title. As everyone knows, this movie was the only word that could help this movie because bad movies can make a lot more money by showing the word'Zombie' in the title. Knowing what Victor Halperin could have done years ago makes this uninteresting movie even more insulting. He doesn't seem to have made another horror movie since this chaos.

Acting is also not good. This film compares the racially insensitive ""king of zombies"" (shown on the same double bill DVD I bought) and reminds me that it looks like a masterpiece of atmospheric fear and not all black and white films are classic. It makes the atomic age sci-fi alien zombie cheese festival ""Invisible Invaders"" look like a serious drama.

"Complaints are valid. The biggest problem for me is that this drama is for women. Soaps for this night like Gray's Anatomy, Ugly Betty, and West Wing are fine.

However, the weekly soap and numerous silly difficult situations in so-called small hospitals, whose idea aims to put soapy men (Taye Diggs, Tim Daly, and Chris Lowell) into sexual tension and trouble during the daytime, seem like regular hospitals. ... or Baywatch's female counterpart.

Well put the movie together!!!! If you have nothing to do during the day, or you need a lot of humor, you'll find this a really good movie. I think Robert and Loper's review of this movie was right. I don't like Evert in most movies, but this is the movie I would agree to. The film contains enough stories to believe that there are actually people of this type. In this film, there is something to be said about how they treat virginity. Yes, you will laugh when it is found, but still suggest you wait.

"Two hours ago I was watching this wonderful movie, which was overwhelmed by the imprisoned photos. Understand how the Cannes 2000 won the Best Camera Award. Close walls, humans and many other things. Warm colors (normally used by directors) gave the movie a warm atmosphere. In most cases, only two people can see it. Exciting music and especially three songs or themes have almost always been with movies. Each of these themes represents a specific mood throughout the movie. Silence and slow motion are hallmarks of the film. Some scenes were enlarged moments or serious scenes of close-ups. Because Maggie Cheung was so good, only Tony Leung deserves his award for his great acting. I wonder how many dresses she was wearing in different scenes.

"This movie could have been a decent remake and watched the movie (or an English teacher tried it). Assembling a competent actor with a successful and experienced writer/director should be a decent movie formula. However, according to her IMDb bio, Mr. English's experience is entirely confined to television work and is noticeably evident throughout this film. It seemed to be made for television. Many jokes that simply didn't work on the movie screen to give the English teacher some credit would have been great on TV (laugh track might have helped). Too much camera usage and lighting played well on the TV, but it seemed awkward or strange on the big screen. It would have worked if the whole movie was cut with a mini-series or sitcom. However, this is a movie and sadly the English talent has not been translated. I cried at so many different points that I felt embarrassed by the actors and writers who seemed to tremble in the theater! Meg Ryan is her ordinary and cute self (except for the terrible plastic surgery she had on her face), but where could she use her talents?! She did a good job of making a movie without reproducing her stereotype role. But not here. Annette Bening seemed to simply be in motion. It was a great talent, but poor performance! I enjoyed other female characters, but there were more caricatures than materials and I was a little sad to see. What worked in this movie in the 1930s wasn't translated into the 2000s, and no one helped the English teacher understand changes, updates, or subtleties. It would have been nice if only she (the author, director, producer) asked for help. It is very frustrating to feel like you are wasting everyone's time and money while going to a movie with stars and great writers or directors! This New Yorker manga I saw yesterday is appropriate. Several film experts are having a meeting and the caption says, ""Let's make everything worse classic!""","The movie may have been a decent remake, and gosh knows it's tried (or English-san tried).Assembling talented actors with successful and experienced writers/directors should be the decent movie official.However, according to her IMDb career, Mr. English's experience was limited to television productions, which is clearly evident throughout the film.It turned out to be the most offensive about this movie and why it didn't even reach some of its potential.It looked and felt like it was created for TV.

"Dear C'mon, some previous reviewers have written almost new comments on this episode. It's just a TV show from the 60s!

"I just watched the best night A movie with curiosity and terrible perfume. I liked ""Mork & Mindy"" as a child for Robin William's passionate energy performance. This movie reminded me of why. Was the original show great? Not really, but Robin certainly did. Bring me to this movie. <br /> <br /> In chronological order of the show, it is amazing to expect only paint. Of course, focus was on Robin. From struggling street jesters to country stars, it was interesting to see how Robin's itinerary and such extreme differences affected him and his troubled wife. Chris Diaman Topofoulos took off my hat, portraying Williams with sincerity, sensitivity and heart. Even cute but not impressive. (In an irrelevant note, I found out that Robin's struggle was in some way similar to Andy Kaufman, whose creativity was not appreciated by network TV, but it was a ""taxi"" hidden behind a vivid scene.<br /> < br /> Overall, this was a very enjoyable movie, and I felt I had learned a little bit more about the man behind Orkan, as I suspected it was never melodic, so the acting was solid and the story went well. The performers had a particularly good performance (Belushi's stealing Robin was great!), but it's not a great masterpiece (you might have wanted to see more about Pam Dawber), especially Robin Williams and ""Mork & This is especially worthwhile for Mindy fans. Nano, nano","I just saw this movie on a great night out of curiosity and nostalgia.When I was a kid, I liked ""Mok & Mindy"" (not loved) because of Rok William's enthusiastic and energetic performance. This movie reminded me of the reason. Did the original show look great? Not really, but Robin certainly did.This takes me to this movie.<br /> <br /> I was surprised to be happy.I wasn't expecting anything other than the chronological repainting of the show But, of course, the real focus was on Robin.It was interesting to see Robin's journey from a struggling clown to television stars across the country, and how such a dramatic difference affected him and his long-suffering wife.And when Chris Diamant Pros portrayed Mr Williams with sincerity, delicacy and heart, my hat was starless.Not only was it a cute impression, but I was serious about it.(In an irrelevant note, I noticed that Robin's struggle was in some ways similar to the underestimated and creatively restrained Andy Kaufmann on networ k television, which was behind the scenes of the biopic ""It's a taxi."") <br /> <br /> Overall, this was a very fun flick and I felt I got to know a little more about the guy behind Orkan. The acting was never melodramatic as I doubted, it was solid and the story worked. Especially good were the guys who played Garry Marshall and John Belushi (the scene where Belushi cheated Robin). It's by no means a great masterpiece (I wanted to see a little more about Pam Dawber), but it's definitely seen, especially for Robin Williams and ""Moke & Mindy"" fans. No, no!"
"I watched this movie on AZN by cable. The Japanese movie ""Green Card"" seemed to be a good movie. I can't say that I hate Asian movies. Some of the most amazing horror movies in history are Japan and Korea, and they are huge fans of John Wu's Hong Kong movies. I thought I liked this because I wasn't disadvantaged by light movies like Tampopo or Chung King Express (two of my favorites). Well, I would rather tear my wrists and drink my blood rather than watch this hard and badly acting movie again. This film had personality. And when DID characters try to act, unlike bling a line or two, their performance is compelling and incredibly fake. Frankly speaking, it was Brenda Aoki. It's amazing that I am promoted as a comedy because I haven't laughed once. Even more surprising is that the CBS morning news called this a ""fresh comedy breath."" It was not a refreshing or comedy breath. And the ending was very predictable, and previous reviewers should be dumb to think about it. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you don't want to see boring predictable plots and tree smoke.","I caught this movie on the cable AZN.It sounds like a good movie called ""Green Card"" in Japan.I can't say I've hated Asian movies so far.Some of the most amazing horror movies of all time are Japan and South Korea.I'm a huge fan of John Woo's Hong Kong movies.I thought I liked this because I'm not at a disadvantage for nimble movies like Dandelion or Chong King Express (two of my favorites).

". Before I start, I get something from my chest. I'm John Eyres' first movie PROJECT:. I am an avid fan of SHADOWCHASER. The B-cross movie of THE TERMINATOR and DIE HARD may not be the work of a cinematic genius, but it is a great fun action movie that has become a cult hit. br /> <br /> Judge and jury ""Bloody Shootout"" (looks like a bad name for killing) -Meeker kill Three people were drawn to the electric chair trying to get rid of the convenience store. Here's a fun scene where Meeker talks with the priest for sex, but meets his true love (who died in a shootout) expressing revenge for the person who killed him. Watching his son Alex play soccer with his high school team, he was bothering his son coach. But once executed, Meeker goes back to the Avengers (or Kelly Perine calls it ""Frying Hamburger""). His only goal is to get revenge. This basically makes Silvano's life unhappy. <br /> <br /> I will point out that judges and juries are not true horror movies. Meeker is a surreal action movie chasing Silvano, dressed up with the ability to change the format (David Keith is Elvis impersonator, French chef (Accent accented with a mustache), Drag Queen), clowns and stand ups Comedian), a shotgun that fires an explosive round and shoots invincibility for death (although Martin Cove doesn't stop Kitty from shooting with the Desert Eagles) pays back Silvano for killing Mike's wife. <br /> <br /> Director John Eyres doesn't seem to be interested in characterization, instead of focusing only on the action scenes that the movie has a lot to do. Paul Koslo, who delivers the performance, and Paul Koslo, who plays the wash-up police well, perform amazingly. Kelly Perine tries to help but is annoying as a driver to make things worse.","Before you start, get something out of your chest.I'm a big fan of John Ayers' first movie, ""Project: Shadow Chaser"".

But once carried out, Meaker, as a revenge (or Kelly Perrine calls it a ""fried potato-free burger""), its only purpose is to take revenge, which is basical ly the life of Silvano.Means to miserable.<br /> <br /> Let me point out the fact that judges and juries are not really horror movies.It's a weird action movie, with his ability to transform Meaker (Elvis impersonation, French chef (with terrible accent as mustache), drag queen), clown & stand-up comedian), explosive A shotgun that fires rounds, immortality to death (though Martin Cove can't stop shooting Keith at Desert Eagle), and refunds to Silvano for killing Meaker's wife.<br /> <br /> Director John Ayers doesn't seem interested in the characters, but instead focuses only on the action scenes that are abundant in the movie. But that's the movie's main downside, as there's nothing connecting action scenes.The acting is amazingly good, and Keith offers the best performance, supported by Kove and Paul Koslo, who plays the washed-out cop very well.Kelly Perrine is annoying as a taxi driver trying to help but make the situation worse."
"Ye Lou's movie Purple Butterfly has its own Purple Butterfly against the Japanese in the Shanghai War. Ding Hui (Jang Tsui) and her ex-lover Hidehiko Itami (Toru Nakamura) find themselves on the other side of the conflict after an accidental encounter. <br /> <br /> I agree with the Paris appraiser. This film replaces the anti-historical conflict for the plot without giving the audience reason to pay attention to the characters or their causes. Sudden time shifting is not a problem because it seems completely inappropriate and meaningless. In general, I don't care about dark movies, but without light, it's difficult to watch and get interested in movies due to the squeaky camera footage and generally bad filmmaking skills. I also agree with viewers In Georgia, this film has a ""filming method with chaotic editing style and claustrophobia,"" but I don't think the movie helps. The background of the film is one of the most influential events of the 20th century, and I don't think it can be edited like a Michael Bay film to do any justice. An excessively melodramatic moment is not added to that vision. <br /> <br /> All actors are depressed appropriately. Zhang Ziyi once again shows that she acts as if she's the best at all of the films throughout the film, and the range of actions is very limited, as if she's depressed and generally annoying. But at least in Terminator, Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton added diversity to this role by participating in the series of smoking and worst love making scenes. <br /> <br /> In the end, what happens to the very disappointing film So Ju-hee 2/10","Ye Lu's movie ""Purple Butterfly"" attacks a secret organization (Purple Butterfly) against the Japanese forces fought in Shanghai.Ding Hui (Zhang Ziyi) and her ex-girlfriend, Hidehiko Itami (Nakamura Toru), find themselves on the other side of the conflict after a chance encounter.<br /> <br /> I agree with the reviewers in Paris.The film uses complex semi-historical conflicts instead of conspiracy and does not give the audience a single reason to care about the characters or their causes Sudden time shifts are not a problem because they look totally meaningless and meaningless.Normal I don't care for dark movies, but the lack of light, painful swaying camera footage, and generally bad filmmaking techniques make this really tough to watch and stay interested. I'll make a movie.I agree with the viewers, ""I have a chaotic editorial style and claustrophobic cinematography,"" from Georgia, but I don't think it helps the movie.The background of this movie is one of the most powerful events of the 20th century, and I don't think it can be edited and do justice like the Michael Bay movie.Overly melodramatic moments do not add to its viewability.<br /> <br /> All actors are properly depressed.Zhang Ziyi spends the whole movie doing what she does best at all movies, and appears to be generally disgusting and disgusting, so her range of acting is very limited.Is shown again.However, at least she adds some variety to this role by chain smoking and is engaged in the worst romance scene since Terminator Michael Bean and Linda Hamilton.<br /> <br /> Overall, watch a very disappointing film, especially how it comes from his director in Suzhou. 2/10"

"I remember seeing this film in the theater in 1984 when I was 6 years-old (you do the math).I absolutely loved it.I was Tarzan for the 2 weeks after seeing it (climbing the furniture, jumping around making monkey sounds) .It started a fascination with Tarzan and monkeys, but oddly enough a longer lasting love for Christopher Lambert (keep in mind that I saw Highlander very shortly after this). 1984 was the last time I saw that film, until about a month ago. It happened to be on cable as I was getting ready for bed at 3:30 am and even though it was late and I was tired and I had to be at work at 9:00 am, I stayed up to watch this movie that I loved as a kid.<br /><br />Upon viewing it I realized that it was not that great of a film and even odder then that, that Andie MacDowell's voice was dubbed by someone else.Ian Holme was of course solid as usual, and surprisingly the monkey suits still kind of held up, but what was most surprising was how good Lambert was as Tarzan. He was grea t! The depth he managed to capture in so few lines, his primal body language and most importantly his ability to bring this character through its extremely large ark, were just amazing.<br /><br />As I stated earlier I am Lambert fan , but I'm used to Highlander, The Hunted and Fortress. In this film he was really quite good and it is a shame that he never got a chance to portray a character with such depth again.<br /><br /> /> So to make a short story way too long, I was a little disappointed that the film was not that good, but I was glad to see that Lambert was good and I do not regret staying up until 6:00am to see it.","I remember seeing this movie in the theater in 1984 when I was six (you are doing math).I like it very much.I was in Tarzan for 2 weeks after seeing it (climbing furniture, making monkey noises).Although fascinated by Tarzan and the monkeys, strangely, his love for Christopher Lambert lasts a long time (remember that I met Highlander shortly after). 1984 was the last time I saw the movie, about a month ago.While preparing for the bed at 3:30 am , it happened to be connected by a cable.Despite being late and tired and having to go to work at 9am, I was up to watch this movie.I was loved since I was a child.<br /> <br /> When I saw it, I found that it wasn't a great movie, and, even more oddly, Andie MacDowell's voice was dubbed by someone else.

It turns reality, the coppola toy, and the jagged memories of his character into a scrapbook that we made proud. He can play the scene, but the editing is quite agile and the movie can't be too heavy (at least there are two or three very rough moments).

"The little girl becomes the Marine's pen pal during the war, and at the end of the war, cartoon complications arise, hoping that someone will be more ""available"". Everything ultimately works well naturally, but not until everyone involved chews the landscape thoroughly. Erol Flynn's bold impression of ""Casa Blanca""'s Humphrey Bogart is a highlight, as well as the various transmissions of his swish image (the ""jumping"" scene in the kitchen with Forest Tucker is a riot). However, Tucker, who ""pushs"" the film under his arm, crosses the goal line and lowers the head and barrel. He shows a more advanced cartoon in ""F-Troop"" 20 years later, and delivers the energy and energy that Flynn plays repeatedly to boost his performance. Eleanor Parker does a great job while the woman is pursuing, and Patty Brady is not attracted to Tucker's real penpal friend.

"This movie is a perfect adaptation of English Flick Unfaithful.

"I don't think I gave it a 1/10 rating, but this gets its name easily. I found it difficult to sit through one of his jokes.

"The first scene of the movie -. Elizabeth Bennett was wandering through the fields at dawn, and in Keira Knightley, the movie theaters of all dramas were developed to address the phenomenon of strong rebellious female characters in this era.<br /> <br /> Joe Wright might not have read this book In addition, it seemed to me that he was sorry for the fact that what he filmed was not actually Jane Austen's subtle and subtle comedy. It's a way done in the 18th century British living room through sparkling and delicate social interaction, but the U certificate Wuthering Heights is a kind. Therefore, we handled all the scenes between Elizabeth and Dashi again for no apparent reason in an unfair harsh environment and often rain. Jane Austen, especially P&P, is not about passion, sexual tension or love. It is about various strategies for negotiating torch in 18th century society. Bennets' home was a bizarre and confusing place where everyone was screaming and running all at once, putting underwear on a chair and pigs wandering happily around the house. Social Ball becomes a wild country dance a step away from the Matrix Reloaded style dance organization. Jane Austen's genius is about exploring the void created by a society where no one says what they think or mean because of overwhelming interest. <br /> <br /> The tragic difficulty of her character comes from misunderstandings and miscommunication made possible by the silent disparity. Thus, Jane Austen's brilliance and her conspiracy, especially the ones that can play a role in this film, have been completely erased. In general, the subtleties are completely different from his films, and sacrificed for an exaggerated drama completely covered with the material and performance. <br /> <br /> I was trying to be a clear movie. Austin's methodology and her appeal, IS Pride & Prejudice, humor were almost completely suppressed in favor of all these infamous melodramas, and were too clumsy when it was allowed. Pride & Prejudice is a serious story that makes a serious point. However, its seriousness and more important topics are not intertwined with humor and are contained within it. You can't lose Jane Austen's skills and leave the heart of the story and expect the theme to stay. Even when replacing her technique with a myriad of fake, fake imitation techniques. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Bennett should be a woman, adult, mature, discerning and insightful woman. Keira Knightley thought the first half of the film was a tragic mistress, like a girl with a giggling blank, and the second with a girl with empty hair. Elizabeth's wit, her fierce language exchange, her own strength, her typical qualities to see and laugh at everyone's stupidity, and her fantastic eyesight completely disappeared... replaced by what? Giggling and staring at the street? When she lost everything, she cried and screamed with a slight provocation rather than hugging her head. No, these were purulent organizations. And the Elizabeth's strength (at least in the eyes of Austin) remained within the boundaries of society and was the ability to maintain integrity and adherence while maintaining the feasibility of impeachment, Knightley's Elizabeth did not consider the convention at all. Moreover, she thought that wandering barefoot in the mud throughout the 18th-century editions undoubtedly made her spiritual and strong, so that no text or performance needed to support it. Incredibly subtle performance. She reasonably matched Matthew Macfayden to find softness and weakness. A relationship that makes Bennett fascinating and tragic. It was because he was the only fool in the special bond with Lizzie, the only two wise people in the world of Babo, and completely stripped the end of the film of emotional influence. Mr. Bingley could no longer speak silly words, played with the perfect delay for an expensive laugh, and the woman who played Jane may not have done anything because she was so inconsistent. Character. The script has changed violently between the enormous chunks of Jane Austen, a completely contemporary language that modern romantic comedies never had. <br /> <br /> Adapt to DVD and seek heartache from the BBC.",映画の最初のショットから-エリザベスベネットが夜明けにフィールドをさまよっているように、キーラナイトレイは、時代劇で強い志向の反抗的な女性キャラクターの現象に対処するために発展したすべてのクリシェ映画を呼び出しました-私は何かに夢中になっていることを知っていました<br /> <br />ジョーライトは本を読んだだけでなく、彼が撮影しているのは実際にはジェーンオースティンの微妙で微妙なコメディではないという残念な誤解の下にあるようでした18世紀の英国の応接室でのきらめく繊細な社会的交流を通じて行われたマナーの一種ですが、ある種のU証明書Wuthering Heightsです。このように、私たちはエリザベスとダーシーの間のすべてのシーンを、はっきりとした理由もなく、不適切な起伏のある風景の中で、しばしば降り注ぐ雨の中で、扱いました。言うまでもなく、ジェーンオースティン、特にP＆Pは、情熱、性的緊張または愛についてではありません。それは18世紀の社会の成体化を交渉するさまざまな戦略についてです。それは完全に無視されたので、ベネッツの家は誰もがすぐに叫び、走り回って、下着を椅子に置き、豚が家の中を楽しく歩き回る騒々しい、混沌とした場所でした。社会のボールは、マトリックスリローデッドスタイルのダンスオージーから一歩離れた乱暴なカントリーダンスになります。誰もが妥当性を少しも考慮せずに、自分の考えていることを正確に言います。<br /> <br />ジェーン・オースティンの天才は、圧倒的な考慮のために誰も彼らが考えたり意味したりすることを誰も言わない社会によって生み出された空白を探究することにあります彼女の性格の悲劇的な苦境は、その無言のギャップによって可能にされた誤解と誤解から生じます。したがって、ジェーンオースティンの輝きと、彼女のプロット（特にこの映画では）が機能するための非常に重要な要素の両方が完全に消去されました。全体的に繊細さは彼の映画のどこにもありませんでした。材料とパフォーマンスに完全にぶつかった過酷なドラマのために犠牲にされました。<br /> <br />それは明らかに*シリアス*な映画になることを試みていました。オースティンの方法論と彼女の魅力の両方である、プライドと偏見であるユーモアは、このすべての顔つきのメロドラマに賛成してほとんど完全に抑制され、それが許可されたとき、とても不器用に扱われました。 Pride＆Prejudiceは、深刻なポイントを生み出す深刻な物語ですが、そうした深刻なポイントとより重要なテーマは、ユーモアと絡み合っているだけでなく、その中に埋め込まれています。ジェーンオースティンのテクニックを失うことはなく、ストーリーの骨だけを残して、テーマが残ることを期待できます。彼女のテクニックをあなた自身の強引な神秘的で偽物の眉毛の映画撮影に置き換えたとしても、そうではありません。<br /> <br />エリザベスベネットは女性であり、成熟していて、賢明ではっきりとした視力を持っているはずです。キーラ・ナイトレイは前半は空頭のくすくす笑う女子高生のように、後半は彼女を悲劇的なヒロインだと考える空頭の女子高生のように演じた。エリザベスの機知、彼女の格好の良い言葉のやりとり、彼女自身のもの、彼女の強さと落ち着き、そして彼女の幻想的な明晰さを含むすべての愚行を見て笑うことができるという彼女の典型的な特徴は完全に失われ、置き換えられました...何ですか？たくさんのクスクス笑いと遠くを見つめていますか？彼女のすべてが彼らを失っているときに彼女の頭を保つことができたのではなく、彼女はほんの少しの挑発で泣き叫び始めました-また、本当の怒りでもありませんでした。いいえ、これらは激しくヒス状の発作でした。そして、オースティンのエリザベス（少なくともオースティンの目には）の大きな強みは、社会の境界内にとどまり、弾劾の妥当性を維持しながら、誠実さと遵守を維持する彼女の能力でしたが、ナイトリーのエリザベスは、慣習をまったく考慮していませんでした。さらに、18世紀バージョンのオーバーオールで泥の中を裸足で歩き回ると、彼女は間違いなく精力的で強い志向であると考えられたため、書かれた文字やパフォーマンスはそれを維持する必要がありませんでした。驚くほど繊細で穏やかなパフォーマンス。穏やかさと弱さの探求において、彼女はマシューマクファイデンとうまく調和していました。<br /> <br />ドネットサザーランドは、人間を犠牲にして、ユーモアのセンスと皮肉な分離がなく、弱く、効果がなく、永続的に困惑しているように見えました。ベネット氏をとても魅力的で悲劇的なものにする関係。愚か者の世界で唯一の賢明な人々であるリジーとの彼の特別な絆は、特に両方とも愚か者の世界で愚か者であり、それが感情的な影響の映画の終わりを完全に奪ったためです。ビングリー氏はもはや愛想が悪く、愚かな点までは意味がありませんでしたが、安っぽい笑いの完全な遅れとしてプレーされました、そしてジェーンを演じていた女性は非常に一貫性がなく、彼女は何もしようとしないでしょうキャラクター。脚本はジェーン・オースティンの逐語的チャンクの間で乱暴に向きを変えました-驚くほどの不器用さで提供されました-現代のロマンチックコメディでは場違いにならない完全に同時期の言語です。<br /> <br /> DVDでBBCの適応を取得するだけで、あなた自身の心の痛みを救ってください。

"Although very young, the Beatles are an absolutely favorite band! I didn't have a chance to listen to music at the time of release, but I loved it since I can remember it. <br /> <br /> It's a movie worth a try. You can see why it wasn't revealed in the movie, but posting it on TV is definitely a great movie. I watched this movie by skimming through the TV guide and said,'After the Beatles broke up, John Lennon and Paul McCartney met. I have never heard of him (he played John) or Aiden Quinn who played Paul. But they are definitely underrated actors! <br /> <br /> The film started slowly, but in the process of development, I was able to see how well Quinn, especially Harris, played the character. As a huge fan, I know what real Lennon and McCartney are like. The script was great and Harris discovered Lennon's accent, personality and mannerism! Queen played McCartney very well, but sometimes went into Irish accents. Makeup artists have made them look great. <br /> <br /> This article can be considered *spoiler*: <br /> <br /> As mentioned earlier, the start started slowly, but soon developed and became a pretty emotional movie. I found some waste of time in the park and lack of character for both musicians. Lennon's rude rows at the Italian restaurant are completely unnecessary. The ending was very pleasant and weeping every time I saw it.<br /> <br /> It's quite different from the other biographical films I've seen about how the Beatles got together and became famous. :. 'Backbeat' <br /> <br /> In the end, if you're a Beatles, John Lennon or Paul McCartney fan, you'll be amazed. <br /> <br /> If anyone knows if the 1976 meeting actually happened, please send it to the ""Comment Page"" of this film.

"This is more than one of the terrible movies you'll see on TV all your life, and it empathizes with the horrible behavior of some disgusting women. Along with other unpleasant movies like ""Burning Bed"", ""Sufficient"" or ""Monster"", the movie brings disgusting criminals and eventually tries to show why she is not so bad. Give us a break! If LeTourneau was a man and Vili was a 12 year old girl, did you take a picture of sympathy and empathy for this man? Answer:.. Hell number <br /> <br /> Imagine changing gender in this movie and you'll see why I think it's useless crap for myself and others trying to empathize with criminals if sex has changed. There will be no attempts. Instead, we'll describe a monster that disgusts a young girl, a terrible man, a lustful behavior hugging him in prison, and a brainwashed victim suffering from Stockholm syndrome. The only reason LeTourneau is not getting the same treatment in this movie is because of her sexuality. <br /> <br /> Let's say the spade is a shovel. LeTourneau is a child. Plain and simple. There are no if, ands or buts. She is a prisoner who deserves our ridicule and contempt. She is our sympathy.","It's one of the horrifying movies I found on Lifetime TV and sympathizes with the abomination of the disgusting woman.Along with other nasty movies like ""The Burning Bed"", ""Enough"", or ""Monster"", this movie will take a nasty criminal and show viewers why she's not such a bad guy in the end will do.Take a break! Here are my questions to filmmakers: If Le Tourneau was a man and Vili was a 12 year old girl, did you take a picture that empathizes with and Answer: Hell no.<br /> <br /> Imagine switching genders in this movie.That way, you can see why I and others consider this a worthless trash.There is no attempt to sympathize with criminals when Their gender changes. Instead, we will probably be treated to a monster and horrifying man who preys on a girl, his lewd behavior landing in his prison, and a depiction of a brainwashed victim suffering from Stockholm Syndrome. The only reason Le Tourneau doesn' t get the same treatment in this movie is because of her sex.<br /> <br /> Let's call the spade a spade. Le Tourneau is a pedophile.

"The premise of this film was fine enough, but with secondary actions, it blunted and dull. It was a murder that the man did not set to do so. Also, some backfire revealed the secret of making the event somewhat like justice. There are no emotions in this movie. The first 20 minutes or so is the woman calling her sister and listening to the message. It was boring and boring. <br /> <br /> It would have been pretty nice to polish a little and act better.","The premise of this movie was decent, but its quasi-equal acting was mediocre and boring.It was a murder, it wasn't like the guy set out to do it.There are also secrets, through some flashbacks, that some events have Turned out to be justice-like events.This movie has no emotions.

"The Saints' life begins with London's atmospheric vision of a bustling, quaint street and a thriving city of sunshine. I wanted this atmosphere to stay, but I was immersed in a story that is nowhere else. <br /> <br /> Othello works for his crime-assisting father, Carva. At least I think it should be because it's not really defined, but you have to trust me because you can drop the cat on a fat fryer. He makes a tricky little errand, and his rough girlfriend holds hands to Dad. One of his colleagues is Runner, a black friend who always runs from A to B. He hopes to stop running until he meets homeless children all day long. The runner throws the lost boy into Othello's apartment and immediately starts making more wishes. Karva kidnapped the boy to satisfy his needs. However, he is not sure what will actually bring him happiness. Again the child's innocence or another job? Either way, I don't want to see the little boy give him a second. <br /> <br /> There are many scenes that take a long time to go and repeat. The ending is about to shock, but it has served as a release for the boring audience because there is little backstory on investing in these characters. <br /> <br /> Terry Gil Liam's favorite Tony Grison writer tries to mix some sort of religious fable, which in the end is contradictory like hell. It would have been a more enjoyable movie if he gave us something more accessible or a better explanation for the character's sudden behaviour. As it is, we introduce an annoying large crowd that seems to miraculously develop intelligence when confronted with a mysterious boy. Whose origin is not revealed. It is just stimulating! <br /> <br /> In addition to the sporadic atmosphere and capricious scores, this film has little to recommend.","The saint's life begins with a vibrant vision of London as a busy, quaint street and the vibrant city of sunlight. I wanted it to maintain this mood, but it gets bogged down with stories that go almost anywhere. <br /> <br /> Othello is a big and fat Kaaba, criminal steppapa (at least I think he should be because it really isn't defined, but he's a kitten To a deep fat fryer, so believe me, he's stinging) One of his colleagues is a runner, a black man who is always in a rush from A to B. The runner discards the lost boy in Othello's apartment, where he immediately begins to make his wish. Eager to fulfill some of his desires, Carba kidnapped the boy. But he doesn't know if he really brings happiness to him. Is it also innocence of being a child or another handicraft? Either way, I don't want to see a little boy give him a second permit. <br /> <br /> It takes years to get started and there are many repetitive scenes. The ending is shocking, but there are few behind-the-scenes stories about investing in these characters, so it only serves as a release for a boring audience. Ironically, they try to mix some sort of religious allegory, but in the end it's hellishly exaggerated. If he offered us something more familiar, or at least had a better explanation of the characters acting suddenly weird, it would have been a more fun movie. As is, we are introduced to a bunch of annoying loudmass that seem to miraculously develop intelligence when confronting a mysterious boy. The origin of no one is revealed. That's plain frustration! <br /> <br /> With the exception of sporadic moments and moody scores, this movie is hardly recommended."
"I can't emphasize it enough. Don't *NOT* this movie for kids. <br /> <br /> For that matter, you will best obtain it from adults. <br /> <br /> Probably, I am exaggerating a little. This is not the worst children's movie. This article is not the worst movie produced by Dissilusioned Adults for Disdislusioned Adults and was sold to kids anyway (""Jack"".

Characters of typical American teenagers are slowly introduced with more personal detail than they appear in movies. When shlitz hits the fans, we know each character and like or dislike them depending on their personality. It's like a slow climb, and it's actually like riding a slope on a tall roller coaster. Thankfully, once the action begins, it is full of old school horrors! Steve Johnson's makeup effect is great. The quality is the same as for a much larger budget movie. And there is a terrifying sound. Kevin Tenney offers the best movies with surprise-setting and horrifying, tense settings. The tongue on the cheeks, sometimes cheese-like humor, is expressed as a horror of the 80's, unlike the dismal tone of early genre fares such as ""The Night of the Living"" or ""Hills Have Eyes"". But for true horror fans, it's worth it. In 1999, remake the ""House on the Ghost Hill"" and use it as the first item in the double bill. The setup and character dynamics are so similar that you have to wonder which movie you are actually remake?","I was surprised at this movie.The opening credit sequence features well-made animations. We then betrayed that low budget and went into a semi-cheap production.Typical American teenage characters are introduced slowly, adding more personal detail than is typically seen in such movies.By the time Schlitz hits fans, we knew each and every one of our characters, and either we like them or we don't, depending on their unique personality.It's a slow uphill climb, like riding on a tall roller coaster slope Thankfully, once the action starts, it's a completely old school horror! Steve Johnson has a great make-up effect. Quality comparable to a much larger budget movie.And fear is upset. Kevin Tenney offers some of the best movies ever, with Incredible surprises and creepy suspense setups.In contrast to the moody tones of earlier genres such as ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Hills Have Eyes,"" warm, sometimes cheesy humor marks the film as pure 80s horror... But for true horror fans, t his is worth checking out.Play as the first entry for a double building in the 1999 remake of ""Hount on the Haunted Hill"".The setup and character dynamics are so similar that you really need to wonder which movie they were recreating?"
"Even though I heard ""Cama de Gato"" as the worst Brazilian movie in 10 years, I saw it give a chance. After all, director and producer/writer Alexandre Stockler made his debut (pictured on video) for $4,000, and even looks much cheaper, but I can't imagine everything he has gone through. Lastly, the exhibition was held in a theater without a sponsor or production company. (Looking at it, I knew why). But even if you are ready to give ""Cama de Gato"", it will drop to zero in 10 minutes. It is an incredibly absurd, verbose, ideologically fanatical and technically fatal attempt to describe the upper Brazilian youth as corrupt. The New Nazis were fascinated by bad sex, drugs and violence (and made them look like closed gays) with no visible talent, imagination, expertise or structural conception. Visually and acoustically, it recalls the worst amateur stuff you can find on YouTube. Here, NINETY TWO (hundreds of years) of constant hysteria and clumsy persists and is not bad for fun. <br /> <br /> We've all seen stories before. Boring young people want fun, go to parties, take drugs and everything goes wrong. There are gang rap, spanking, murder, and accidental death (falling down the stairs). The climax with the boys, one of the boys, who decided to burn the trash from the mother, girls and dead body to the landfill. Moral and literal crap, okay? This movie was heavily influenced by Larry Clark (especially ""Kids"" and ""Bully""), but compared to this movie, Clark's movie (also moral and greedy) is a high-end masterpiece. <br /> <br /> I Don't think that filmmakers have such a monotonous drive that hits the audience's neck with their ideas. Stocker grabs us with the collar and tries to force his brain through repetition and exhaustion of his nonstop moral list. There is a rippling noise, a screaming and improper direction, a swaying camera and terrible smoke. Stalkers aren't interested in skills (image quality, framing, sound recording, soundtrack songs, conversations, sets, editing, etc. are consistently terrible), but they are narcissistic control monsters. He anticipates his own criticism. You can get it by adding subtitles with the smartie/cutie annotation and mentioning how far the main character is from one point and mentioning it is fake (related to THAT). <br /> <br /> Despite the extraordinary ambition, Stockler seems to be unable to provide minimal visual or descriptive structure. He's a realistic handheld camera (such as a handheld video camera) or styling (repeats scenes, uses alternate takes, etc.). Damn, he couldn't decide where to put the camera (I'm using a subjective camera for 3 leads)! There is the most stupid mediocrity in this conversation. The plot simply exists to justify the director's profound hatred of his character and what they mean. It is the filmmaker that the filmmaker feels hatred, preaching, criticism, and morality without the benefit of minimal talent (or skill). <br /> <br /> Finding Caio Blat in this mess is very frustrating. Definitely one of Brazil's most promising young actors, Sal Mineo's sleepy dog ​​look and emotional edge, Blat can be very effective in a good direction (""Carandiru"", ""Lavoura Arcaica"", ""Proibido Proibir""). Here he was told to go over the summit and has to play with the ""actors"" who are not the most embarrassed in recent memories. He also enters the dangerous realm of the graphic explosion scene. The episode begins with a real interview with a ""typical"" middle class youth. It ends (?) -. Stocker wants us to regard what he is trying to preach in fiction in an interview as ""evidence,"" but he is absurd and racial. Choosing the highlights of discrimination, gender discrimination, and foolish words, shamelessly despises and makes his interviewees fun. Stokler wants to prove that Brazilian middle-class youth are both current or future fascists. Because he is a middle class, he enjoys recreational drugs (he says that all the god fascists are in drugs ??don't tell me). <br /> <br /> With his dogmatic intentions, headache-provoking skills and mind-bending boredom, ""Cama de Gato"" is bad for a thousand reasons, but above all it's harmful in a very cunning way. It provides a strong example of argument for the detractors of Brazilian cinema. ""Cama de Gato"" is best seen, not mentioned, buried and forgotten.","「カマデガト」はこの10年間で最悪のブラジル映画であると聞いたことがありますが、私はそれを見てチャンスを与えました。結局のところ、初めての監督/プロデューサー/ライターのAlexandre Stocklerは、たったの4,000米ドルでデビュー機能（ビデオで撮影）を作ることができました。それはさらに安く見えますが、彼が経験したすべてを想像することはできません。大きなスポンサーや制作会社のいない劇場で最後にそれを展示するために（それを見たとき、私はその理由に気付きました）。しかし、あなたが「カマデガト」に与える準備ができている可能性が何であれ、それらは10分以内にゼロに縮小します。これは、信じられないほど冗長で、イデオロギー的に狂信的で技術的に壊滅的な試みであり、ブラジルの上流階級の若者をだまされた束として描写しようとします。ネオナチは悪質なセックス、麻薬、暴力に夢中になり（そして、彼らはまた閉じ込められたゲイのように見えるように作られました）、目に見える才能、想像力、専門知識、構造の概念の痕跡はありませんでした。視覚的にも聴覚的にも、YouTubeで見つけることができる最悪のアマチュアのものを思い起こさせます。ここでのみ、それはNINETY TWO（count'em）分の容赦ないヒステリーと不器用さを持続させ、それはおかしくないことでもありません。<br /> <br / >私たちは皆、以前にその話を見ました：退屈な若い男たちは楽しみたい、パーティーに行って薬物を飲みたい、すべてがうまくいかない-集団レイプ、平手打ち、殺人、偶然の死（階段を降りて!!）男の子の一人の母親は、女の子と母親の遺体をゴミ捨て場で焼却することを決定した男の子で最高潮に達しました。道徳的で文字通りのゴミ、それを入手？この映画はラリークラーク（特に「キッズ」と「いじめ」）の影響を強く受けていますが、クラークの映画は、道徳的で性差別的ではありますが、このがらくたに比べると一流の傑作です。<br /> <br />私は映画製作者が観客の喉に彼のアイデアを押し付けようとするような一方向の熱狂的なドライブがあったとは思わない：ストックラーは首輪で私たちをつかみ、繰り返しと疲労によって彼のノンストップの道徳主義者の怒りを私たちの脳に押し付けようとします-あなたは得るあまりにも多くのせせらぎ、叫び声、不適当な方向性、不安定なカメラ、そして恐ろしい行動が続いていることで、麻痺した心を持っています。 Stocklerはテクニック（画像、フレーミング、サウンドレコーディング、サウンドトラックの曲、ダイアログ、セット、編集などの品質が一律に恐ろしい）について少し気にしませんが、彼は自己陶酔的なコントロールフリークです。彼は自分が縛られている批判を予想していますsmartie / cutieコメント付きの字幕を追加し、ある時点で主人公にどれだけ遠くで偽っているのかをコメントさせることで得ることができます（私はそれに関係するかもしれません）。 <br /> <br />彼の大妄想的な野心にもかかわらず、ストックラーは私たちに最小限の視覚的または物語的な構造を与えることができないようです-彼はザラザラしたリアリズム（ハンドヘルドビデオカメラなど）またはスタイル設定（欲望）を望んでいるかどうかさえ決めることができません。シーンの繰り返し、代替テイクの使用など）。くそー、彼はどこにカメラを置くかさえ決めることができません（3つのリードに主観的なカメラを使用しています）。ダイアログには、これまでで最も驚くほど平凡な冗長性がいくつか含まれています。陰謀は単に彼のキャラクターに対するディレクターの深い憎悪と彼らが何を表すかを正当化するためだけに存在します。あなたが目にするのは、それに伴う最低限の才能（またはテクニック）の恩恵なしに、憎悪、説教、非難、道徳的である映画製作者だけです。<br /> <br />この混乱の中でCaio Blatを見つけるのは非常に残念です。確かにブラジルで最も有望な若い映画俳優の1人で、眠そうな目をした子犬の外見と、サルミネオのことをよく思い出させる感情的なエッジがあるため、Blatは良い方向で非常に効果的です（「Carandiru」、「Lavoura Arcaica」、「 Proibido Proibir」）。ここでは、彼はトップを超えるように言われ、最近の記憶の中で最も恥ずかしいほど装備が不十分な「俳優」のいくつかと遊ぶ必要があります。彼はまた、グラフィックの性的搾取シーンの危険な領域に入ります（そのため、彼らはウェブカメラポルノのように見えます）。<br /> <br />映画は、「典型的な」（？）中産階級の若者との本当のインタビューで始まり、終わります-ストックラーは、これらのインタビューをフィクションで説教しようとしていることの「証拠」としてとらえたいと思っています。しかし、彼は露骨に侮辱し、面接者をからかい、卑劣な、人種差別、性差別、愚かな発言のハイライトを選択します（これは、いたずらがどこにでも存在することだけを示しています）。ストックラーは、ブラジルの中産階級の若者がすべて現在または将来のファシストであることを証明したいと考えています。なぜなら、彼らは中流階級であり、レクリエーションドラッグを楽しんでいるからです。言わない）。 <br /> <br />独断的な自己正義、頭痛を誘発するテクニック、そして心を曲げる退屈さで、「カマデガト」は1,000の理由で悪いですが、何よりも、非常に油断できない方法で有害です。ブラジル映画の批判者に強力な議論の余地を与える。 「カマデガト」は、誰も見ていない、言及されていない、埋もれ、忘れられている最高の場所です。"
"An unforgettable masterpiece by the creators of Nimh's Secret and Time Before Time, this was a very touching sweet cartoon. I remember this very well since childhood. Interesting, sad and very beautiful. Well, it starts a little dark. The one who escaped the pound dies by an old friend, ends up in heaven and returns. However, he becomes sweet even when he becomes friends with an orphan girl who can communicate with animals.

And Judah's Judith Barsi revenge, God is her soul, poor girl, she was not deserved to die, but now she is in heaven. All good people go to heaven. Overall, this is Don Bluth Classic, an animated movie that's as good as shy of animation and Disney. It is recommended for the whole family.

"This film was a failure as a general comedy film. It was a very slow-paced movie that seemed to try to convey the message, but the message began with a banal, desperate mess. The film offers a voluntary point of destroying the SUV and promoting Animal Planet without falling into a shameful environment. <br /> <br /> In solving this problem, Steve Carell is no longer helpful. Than one really fun line. The only thing that can hypothetically mark this as a comedy is the poor attempt to provide comic relief to Wanda Sykes. In contrast to the brilliance of Bruce Almighty, Evan Almighty also smashed the record budget for special effects devices. <br /> <br /> Advance the plot. The film uses the first half to build Evan's ark, but eventually found that the ark was completely meaningless, and that the whole plot was just a container for stupid gags and silly messages. The movie ends when we realize that the entire Ark, Flood, and Animal Gathering is a weak political statement except for God. That's right. God tried to influence politics.","This movie was a comedy and a movie failure.It was a very slow-paced movie that seemed to convey the message, but the message was rude and desperate mess from the start.The film fits into the shameless environment, creating a selfish point of Destroying the SUV and promoting the Animal Planet.More than a single really funny line.The only thing you can assume this as a comedy is a pathetic attempt to give Wanda Sykes a comic relief line. Her character often becomes a boring, valuable line, And they never fit.Finally proceed with the plan.In this movie, the first half was spent on the construction of Evan's ark, but at the end the ark is completely pointless, and the whole plot is even a stupid gag and even a fool's. message.I understand.The film ends when it is learned that the ark, the flood, and the entire flock of animals were weak political statements from nothing but God.Yes, God was trying to influence politics."
"It's great to see one great piece of art transformed into another piece of art without being distorted or stuck. I couldn't guess how such a great literary work could be reproduced as a movie worth seeing. If you liked Bulgakov's book, you'd be afraid to see more misinterpreted interpretations for art film projects than actually bringing the deeper meaning of the story to the screen. There are a few examples of mentors and margaritas. As the story is complex and widespread, the film leaves nothing behind. It's like a filmmaker reading Bulgakov's work in the same way that an orchestra conductor reads scores without reading sheet music. Why can't you find such talent in America? Now my favorite books and movies have the same title.","It's great to see a wonderful work of art transformed into another work of art without distortion or ingenuity.I couldn't imagine how such an extraordinary literary work would be reproduced as a movie worth seeing.If you loved Bulgakov's books, you would, of course, be afraid of being misinterpreted for an art film project rather than actually bringing the deeper meaning of the story to the screen.There are several examples of Master and Margarita.I won't skip anything about the movie, because it's as complicated and far away as the story.It's as if the filmmakers read Bulgakov's work in the same way that orchestra conductors read sheet music-don't miss the sound.Why can't we find such a talent here in America?

"The film is very intense, but it's exciting with original conversations and cool characters. It is one of the most touching stories and is very true to life. The film begins with down and out cops approaching the end of his career as he stumbles into big events involving corruption, intimidation and murder, along with action star Leo Fong. Murder begins here. From the start, Fong must meet action capers. The film is also a co-star of Richard Roundtree. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie when I was young, but as I got older, I realized that this movie was pretty tasty and not good.

"That day, finally, I finally saw Azumi's fate as the assassin, the fruit of her personality, and the ultimate attempt to immerse her deeper into the world that ruthlessly popped out during her first saga. <br /> <br /> Azumi 2:. Poetic when you're talking about death or love I saw Azumi because Aya Ueto complained about the credibility of portraying a bloody assassin when she cried about the heavy feelings of a flying dagger in the sky. 2 I started to appreciate the shortcomings mentioned earlier than ever before. <br /> <br /> Each assassin's decision is slow and unpleasant, and many important elements have been omitted from the whole experience. In Azumi 1, we saw assassins using logic to easily use the mark with a variety of stealth tactics (highest priority) and faster running and faster escape abilities. But this time, I won't comment too much on this film, as the story is a little tweaked and more obstacles have been planted in Azumi's way to prevent her from reaching the generals and showing signs of charisma. By the way, Chiaki foolishly puts most of the movie on the shelf and basically plays a toned down version of Go Go, excluding cool weapons and threats. <br /> <br /> In the action, blow is the masquerade of the epic'death' in the title. In the first half of the movie, many promising enemies made their debut with gorgeous looks and more colorful weapons. Surprisingly, they met the end in some way, but if the film starts to die too quickly, the film runs out. In Azumi 1, the young assassins were mostly overwhelming the opposition in a quick but rather satisfactory battle, and the final confrontation between Azumi and Bijomaru was at least climax and worth it compared to the fight in Azumi 2. Several interesting effects were introduced, but the lack of each encounter prevented innovation from being achieved. I can't break the old samurai movie style with a fast and realistic battle, but the characters in both Azumi movies are so imaginative and the rules are broken, making rules harder and action richer. <Br /> <br /> Azumi's romance fills the time between battle scenes and, unfortunately, eventually serves no purpose and doesn't provide much of the required resolution. <br /> <br /> With an open mind to various movies and animations, I lied. I won't, and I will admit my neutrality and impression on the first Azumi movie, but I went very far ahead and made it look like a perfect masterpiece after seeing Azumi 2, for what is worth it, Azumi 2: Death or love is not noticeable I was able to go straight to the video, with the potential to add or expand the bumpy journey of a desperate assassin with more budget, and did my best to restore peace. Unwavering courage to try death.","The day has finally come to witness Azumi's fate as an assassin, her personality to fruition, and the ultimate attempt to lure me into a world that mercilessly rampaged during the first story.<br /> <br /> Azumi 2: It's as poetic as talking about death or love.It was because he saw Azumi when he overcame the severe sentiment of the Flying Dagger and complained about the credibility of Aya Ueto's portraying a blood-driven assassin. 2 I've started to appreciate more than ever the wounds Mentioned above.<br /> <br /> Not only does each assassin's judgment not seem dull, but many key elements have been omitted from the overall experience.In Azumi 1, we've found that assassins can use various stealth tactics (top priority) and logic to easily manipulate marks with rapid execution and rapid escape capabilities.However, the story this time has been tweaked a bit, and I've added even more obstacles to Azumi's method, so that Azumi doesn't reach the warlords and show signs of charisma, so I'm in this movie.I don't have that much.By the way, Chiaki is ridiculously shelved for most of the movie, basically playing a tone-down version of Go Go, except for the cool weapons and sense of threat .<br /> <br /> Now I'm finally here.The action blow is disguised in the title simply as the ""death"" side of the epic. In the first half of the film, we see the debut of many promising Enemies with flashy looks and flashy weapons.Not to everyone's surprise, they end up somehow, but when each of them begins to die too quickly and easily, the film is inadequate.In Azumi 1, the young assassins overwhelmed the opposition in a quick and somewhat satisfying battle, and the final showdown between Azumi and Bijomaru compared to the battle in Azumi 2 was at least climax-worthy and worthwhile.Some interesting effects were introduced, but we were unable to achieve innovation because of the short encounters between them.We aren't defeating the traditional style of samurai movies in a quick and realistic battle, but the characters in both Azumi movies are imaginative and break out of the anime, so they can break the rules.Yes, and the actions should be more fulfilling.<br /> <br /> Azumi's romance side is there. to fill the time between battle scenes, and unfortunately doesn't serve the purpose in the end and doesn't provide the necessary solution either.<br /> <br /> Being open to a wide variety of movies and animations, I admit I'm not lying and neutral and unimpressive to the first Azumi movie, but I'm azumi 2 After seeing, the original was made like a perfect masterpiece.For what it's worth, Azumi 2: Death O'Arab is the best to recover peace, failing to add or expand an invisible wealthy budget and the bumpy journey of a desperate assassin.

"I haven't read Anne Rice's novel, which was the basis for this movie, but I know that reading a book is cheaper than renting a QUEEN OF THE DAMNED and probably better for your health. It's not that this movie is not necessarily bad for your health, but the book is very comfortable and allows you to practice more active parts of your brain than this movie. I can count the number of pages that Anne Rice read with one hand, but after watching this movie and an interview with the vampire, I felt that she was writing a really good novel. The conspiracy of the two films suggests the entire sea of ​​vampire history, deep and interwoven. <br /> <br /> Stuart Townsend's audio commentary is still far more annoying than Brad Pitt's vampire narrative. You can say that the QUEEN of DAMNED's limited production resources does not give enough flesh to the Anne Rice story. The interview decided to pursue race and elegance, but QUEEN tried to take it seriously, relying on the low-budget special effects.

The sound track is excellent. Korn and Disturbed have knocked me down with a disease that stings my noggin like Butthead. Quickly. The film was so long that I realized that the director didn't have enough time and money to perform the novel definition of Anne Rice. The result is an ordinary vampire scene and many cheese special effects. Unfortunately, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED does not define the genre as John Carpenter was not impressed. Where are the yellow contacts? Where is the pale blue makeup? With a low budget, my budget shook my head, recalling the day of Lot and Fright Night. <br /> <br /> This film is available from garbage, but it has qualities. It is preached to Alya, and her soul can remain peaceful forever. She might have become a famous actress, or if she hadn't taken her life too early from us, it's because this film did a decent performance with this great belly dance. Did you mention that the soundtrack was good? What can i say? It wasn't too long. An ambitious director like Francis Ford Coppola could easily have a three-hour movie for Anne Rice. There is some distortion here and there in the plot. However, as a rule, it became a legitimate rock and roll, with the addition of a second-class vampire film, where the director continued to produce a new series of Battlestar Galactica minis. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />","I haven't read the novel by Unrice, which was the basis of this movie, but I think reading the book is cheaper than renting Queen of the Damned and probably better for your health.

The director noticed that the film was so long that he did not have enough time and money to do the justice in Unrice's novel. The result is some mediocre vampire scenes and lots of crappy special effects. Unfortunately, Queen of the Damned does not follow the genre of justice, as John Carpenter's counterpart did not impress. Where are the yellow contacts? Where is the light blue makeup? For each scene, I shook my head, remembering the lot of Salem and nights of horror when the low budget was properly done. <br /> <br /> There are qualities that can be used to save this movie from the trash. Props to Aaliyah, and her soul resting in peace forever. She may have been a famous actress, but if her life wasn't robbed of us too soon, she gave this movie a decent performance with plenty of nice belly dance. It was Did you say the soundtrack was good? Let's see, what else can you say? It wasn't long. Ann Rice's novel would have been a three-hour movie if acquired by an ambitious director like Francis Ford Coppola. There are some twists and rotations around the plot. But in the end, it was a legitimate addition of rock and roll to the number of second-class vampire movies out there. The director of this movie kept on directing if the new Battlestar Galactica mini-series could tell us what. <br /> <br /> JY <br /> <br /> Jimboduck-dot-com"
"I think I'm a fan of Babylon 5 television series, but the original movie that introduced the series has a weak start. There are many factors that will mature later and become much more attractive in the series, but the speed of the meeting is slow, the makeup is rather inappropriate, and the plot is confusing. Moreover, the characteristics of the Premier episode are not good. Many fans in the ratings chart are overlooking these issues, but remember that The Gathering soon turned out to be a spectacular series.","I think I'm a fan of the Babylon 5 TV series, but I didn't like the original movie that introduced this series.Maturity later, there are many of the much more compelling elements in the series, but the gathering is slow- paced, slightly under-structured, and the plot is confusing.

"Leonard Maltin gave this film a BOMB rating in the 1995 Film and Video Guide. What movie was he watching? Kid Vengeance or God's Gun is a bomb. This movie is a joy. This is fantastic. I am illiterate. Well equipped. It is beautifully shot and uses colors brilliantly. In the opening scene, the film captures your attention and tells you that it is a satire of the spaghetti western genre. The movie is played for laughter from start to finish with homage to the famous showdowns of Douglas Fairbanks, 77 Sunset Strip, Good, Bad and Ugly. Edd Byrnes, George Hilton and Gilbert Roland work great together for satire work. Maltin was too bad to improperly rate this movie. You can only guess for your own reasons. I thought he had completely missed the point of the movie and was expecting something more serious than this one. Kudos belongs to everyone who participated in this project. This movie is a little gem waiting for people who like illiterate movies and satire lovers to discover.","Leonard Martin gave this movie a terrifying BOMB rating in its 1995 movie and video guide.

"I don't believe there are worse or worse television programs to broadcast in the United States with 700 clubs. They are the same today as the 20th century Ku Klux Klan. Their hatred for everything that is good, sweet, human, and pure transcends all the ability to understand. Their constant attack on millions of people around the world, as well as millions and millions of Americans around the world, share their gigantic, brutal, freaking, and enthusiastic views of humanity beyond what they have seen on television. It is thought that the lies they spit out and the ridiculous lies they are trying to pass by, such as the thoughts of ""life after death"", ""god"" or ""sin"" or ""devil"" are actually mentally ill. They are in fantasy. The Sane people know that religion is a drug and should not be addicted to that illusion. However, 700 clubs are in class on their own. They are truly cult. I believe in freedom of speech, but they hate, lie, spread information, and fantastic ideas go beyond all limits. I hope that one day the American Psychiatric Association will finally end its study of those who deceive themselves in this way and who have deeply plunged into the land of fantasy religion so that they no longer have the real concept of reality. Treatment for such suffering people in the country is desperately needed, as they have completely lost their minds about the visions of this religion. The 700 Club is even more terrible as it goes up to the legal definition of'cult', but it's above the laws of the country due to the vast wealth of 700 clubs (millions of Americans are deceived every day). The movie ""The Matrix"" Anyone who has watched knows that the movie is a metaphor for religion on earth. The wicked at the top of each religion cruelly abuse their prisoners.

"The Golden Door is a story of the Sicilian family traveling from the Old World (Italy) to the New World (USA). Salvatore, a middle-aged man who wants a more beneficial life, persuades his family to leave his hometown in Sicily, take a hard journey across the raging sea, and inhabit the land where the river flows into milk. In short, they believe that if you risk everything for the new world, your dream of prosperity will be fulfilled. The image of the new world is optimistic, smart and imaginative. He rains in the sky on Salvatore, anticipating how prosperous he will be in the new world. Carrots and onions are harvested to offer wealth and health at twice the size of a human being, and rivers are flooded and flow through the hearts of those who expect what the new world will get. All of these images are surreally woven with the characters and wonderfully compliment the wacky realism that the story unfolds to the audience. The contrast between this image and the dark reality of the Sicilians helps them provide hope while boarding a ship to a new world. <br /> <br /> The voyage to a new world is filmed in almost complete darkness. When sea storms roar and almost kill people. The dark reality I mentioned is a journey to the Old World and New World. The Old World is described as somewhat poor and primitive. It seems that Salvatore scrambles together to sell the leftovers (donkeys, goats, rabbits) to get the proper clothing needed to get together and enter the new world. I thought it was somewhat interesting to think that these people had to follow certain dress codes to be accepted in the new world. It was almost suggesting that people must fit into certain stereotypes or frameworks in order to be perceived as morally fit. The most powerful image in the movie was the moment the ship left its homeland and sailed to a new world. This photograph depicts the separation of the Old World and the New World, showing the overhead of many who seem to be slowly separated from each other. The scene also suggested that people want to get ripped off from everyone they were once familiar with, and want to get divorced in the former dark living conditions and enter a world with more promises. <Br /> <br /> In contrast, depending on how the new world looks visually in contrast, the old world looks dark and desolate compared to the bright and foggy new world. Though I never saw the Statue of Liberty through the mist on Ellis Island, I thought it was particularly interesting to remain hidden. I think this is an intentional choice of instruction that seems to deny the purpose of what the Statue of Liberty means. It seemed like a joke about when people should say, ""My poor, tired and hungry."" Arrive in a new world. After they arrived in the Americas, they had to go through some rather humiliating tests (ie, handling, math, puzzles, etc.) to prove that they were suitable for the new world. This test completely changed the view of the Sicilian people. In particular, Salvatore's mother had the most difficult time obeying the rules and laws of the new world, and felt more violated than respect. Where their dreams once provided hope and optimism for what the new world would offer, the reality of what the new world demands was mean and rude. Salvatore hasn't changed much except for how he feels the new world might have been and what the new world actually looks like to be disappointed with him. This attitude was shared by most people who sailed with him. Their personality issue is better dealing with cherished dreams and dark realities that need to be accepted. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to make a strong comment about preparing itself to enter the celestial civilization society. Cleanliness, marriage and information are prerequisites. Adhering to these rules prevents disease, immoral behavior, and stupidity from taking over. Perhaps this is a commentary on how America learned from the failures of other countries. Therefore, it was intentionally established to prevent these catastrophes from being transmitted and destroyed. The rules seem strict, but existed to help protect people and prosper.",ゴールデンドアは、旧世界（イタリア）から新世界（アメリカ）へのシチリアの家族の旅の物語です。より実りある人生を望んでいる中年男性のサルバトーレは、家族を説得してシチリア島の故郷を後にし、荒れ狂う海を渡って困難な旅をし、川に牛乳が流れていると思われる土地に住まわせます。要するに、彼らは新世界のためにすべてを危険にさらすことによって彼らの繁栄の夢が実現されると信じています。新世界のイメージは、楽観的で賢く、想像力に富んでいます。銀貨は、彼が新世界でどれほど繁栄するかを予想しているときに、サルバトーレに天から降ります。人間の2倍の大きさのニンジンとタマネギは、富と健康を示唆するために収穫されていることが示され、牛乳の川が泳ぎ、新世界がもたらすものを予想する人々の心の中を流れています。このすべての画像は、キャラクターと超現実的に織り交ぜられており、ストーリーが聴衆に展開するザラザラしたリアリズムをうまく補完しています。この画像とシチリアの人々の暗い現実のコントラストは、新世界への船に乗っている間に希望を与えるのに役立ちます。<br /> <br />新世界への航海は、ほぼ完全な暗闇の中で特に撮影されます海が猛威を振るい、中にいる人々を殺そうとするとき。私が言及した暗い現実は、旧世界と新世界への旅そのものです。旧世界はやや貧しく原始的なものとして描かれています。これは、サルヴァトーレが新しい世界に入るのに必要な適切な衣服を手に入れるために、彼が残したもの（ロバ、ヤギ、ウサギ）のいくつかのものを売るために一緒にスクランブルをかけていることを示しています。これらの人々が新世界で受け入れられるためには、特定の服装規定に従う必要があると信じているのは、かなり興味深いと思いました。道徳的に適合していると認識されるためには、人々が特定のステレオタイプまたは型に適合しなければならないことをほとんど示唆していました。映画の中で最も強力なイメージは、船が故郷を離れ、新世界に向けて出航するときでした。このショットは、古い世界と新しい世界の分離を描いた、ゆっくりとお互いから離れているように見える人々の群衆の俯瞰図を示しています。このショットはまた、人々がかつて馴染みのあったものすべてから引き裂かれ、以前の暗い生活条件から離婚したいと考え、より多くの約束があった世界に入ることを望んでいたことを示唆しました。<br /> <br />後で対照的に新世界が視覚的にどのように見えるかについては、旧世界は明るくて霧の多い新世界に比べて暗く暗いように見えます。自由の女神がエリス島の霧の中を通り抜けることができず、隠されたままになっているのは特に興味深いと思いました。これは、自由の女神が表すものの目的を打ち消すように思われた意図的な監督の選択だったと思います：「あなたの貧しい人、あなたの疲れた、あなたの空腹をください」は、これらの人々が経験しなければならないことに関して、冗談のように見えました新世界に到着。彼らがアメリカ大陸に到着したら、彼らは新世界にふさわしいものであることを証明するために、かなり屈辱的なテスト（すなわち、害虫駆除、数学、パズルなど）を行わなければなりませんでした。これらのテストはシチリアの人々の見方を完全に変えました。特に、サルヴァトーレの母親は、新世界の規則や法律に身を委ねるのが最も困難で、敬意を払うよりも違反されていると感じていました。彼らの夢がかつて新世界が提供するものに希望と楽観を与えたところで、新世界が必要とするものの現実は中傷的で失礼なものでした。サルヴァトーレは、新世界が実際に失望しているように見えたのに対して、新世界がどのように感じられるかに対する彼の態度以外はほとんど変わりません。この態度は彼と一緒に航海したほとんどすべての人によって共有されました。彼らのキャラクターアークは、大いに動揺している大事な夢と受け入れられなければならなかった暗い現実にもっと対処します。<br /> <br />この映画は、天国と文明社会に入る準備をすることについて強力な解説をしているようです。清潔さ、結婚、知性が前提条件です。これらのルールを守ることは、病気、不道徳な行動、愚かさが支配するのを防ぐことです。おそらくこれは、アメリカが他の国の失敗からどのように学んだかについての解説であり、故意にこれらの疫病が蔓延したり破壊したりしないことを保証するために設立されました。ルールは厳格に見えたが、人々を保護し、繁栄するのを助けるためにそこにあった。

"If you keep a solid historical perspective from it, this movie is actually very interesting. Action, adventure, romance, and one of the main cast matchups between Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland. As you can see on this board, this painting is not far from purists who seek 100% accuracy in storytelling. To go beyond that, put aside the history book and enjoy the story as if it were a novel. I know it's hard considering Custer's last stand at Little Bighorn, and I know it stands out in the history since the Civil War. Regardless of how you look, I think there is an unresolved temporary space in the picture. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of things here in the 2 hours + run time of the picture. Upon arriving at West Point, Custer is probably the first head scraper, as in the first military regalia. The real joke when Arthur Kennedy stood at Major's headquarters was probably both in trouble. First meeting with Libby Bacon and subsequent meetings including tea reader Callie (Hattie McDaniel). I didn't notice it in other movies, but McDaniel reminded me of another favorite character actor from Forties, Mantan Moreland. In one scene, Moreland would have appeared to be wearing a dress. With that in mind, the owl scene was also popular. <br /> <br /> A year ago, Flynn was competing to draw attention from others outside Olivia De Havilland, against JEB Stewart's description of General Ronald Reagan's Custer on the ""Santa Fe Trail"". In this film, Reagan never put arrogance and splendor on the character of Custer that history remembers, and it is clear from Flynn's description. However, in the ""Little Big Man"" of the 1970s, Richard Milligan was not close to the occupation of an army hero. <br /> <br /> The better way to take pictures was for Custer to keep his good name and not to gamble in a dangerous business. speculation. His loyalty to the people who led the battle along with the story and the training he developed in the course he spoke. Shortly before riding on Little Bighorn, the final showdown with Arch Rival Sharp declared that hell or glory was entirely up to his point of view. In a similar way, the insight into Custer's personality would have been the best.","Without a rigorous historical perspective, the film is actually quite entertaining.With action, adventure and romance, it was one of the premier casting matchups of the time, with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland leading the way.As you can see on this board , this picture fails for purists who want 100% accuracy in storytelling.To get over it, simply set aside a history book and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction.What I know is difficult considering Custer's last stand at the Little Big Horn, which stood out in American history after the Civil War.So, no matter how you look at it, I think photography has unsolved challenges.<br /> <br /> In the two hours and run time of the photo, There is a lot of work to be done here.Custer arrived at West Point, probably the first scratcher, riding as it does in full military Regalia.The realistic joke that Sharp (Arthur Kennedy) placed him at the headquarters of the Major would probably have had problems with both.<br /> <br /> Ironically, many scenes in this military film will be staged in comedies like Custer's first meeting with Libby Bacon, and later including Tea Leader Callie (Hattie McDaniel).

In one scene, Moreland seemed to be humming to the dress.With that in mind, the owl scene was a chore.<br /> <br /> Regarding Flynn, one year ago JEB Stuart was on the other side of General Custer's portrayal by Ronald Reagan in ""Santa Fe Trail"", neither of which was for anyone except Olivia De Havilland. We are also competing for attention. In that movie, Reagan doesn't add any arrogance or flashiness to the personality of Custer that history remembers, but that's evident in Flynn's portrayal. But that's not close to what Richard Mulligan took over as a military hero in the 1970s ""Little Big Man."" Just say it was a little bit higher.<br /> <br /> It would have bee n better if Custer kept a good name and did his best not to bet it on risky businesses to get me a picture of a venture.And his loyalty to the man he led in the fight, along with the discipline he developed in the process of The final showdown with arch rival Sharp, shortly before riding the Little Big Horn, was most impressive with the declaration that hell and glory were completely dependent on his point of view.In the past, similar remarks may have given us all the best insight into Custer's personality."

"The movie about WWII produced by a British production company during World War II, in my opinion, has no fellow of the latter, and the joining of many things that are close to my heart and lovely are in our dive at dawn:. As a descendant of Admiral Horatio Nelson and a student of all aspects of World War II, especially the Naval War, I like the portrayal of North Korea's submarines and actions. Things that include the Atlantic and especially the German side. For those unfamiliar with target priorities, the attack on enemy ships is the biggest thing a submarine wants to face, and such a rare opportunity will surprisingly evolve from what we see here. The gaps are deliberate and come from typical Ealing, Rank and British-Gaumont studios. Honestly, I prefer a quieter, more cerebral approach to humanity and realism that is much better than the overproduced Hollywood movie. This reminds me of Powell and Pressburger's 49th Parallel, thanks to my strong and persuasive Eric Portman. John Mills received a second bill and a small font in the title, so it certainly became a Portman movie, but the entire cast shines. Is the title sequence the only person who's completely attracted to Gainsborough Production's lovely pre-CGI Gainsborough Girl?","Movies about World War II made by British production companies during World War II, in my opinion, are not shunned.At Dawn We Dive brings together many things that are close to my heart.A descendant of Admiral Horatio Nelson and a student of all aspects of World War II, especially the naval battle, I like to depict submarines and their behavior in the North Atlantic, especially those involving the German side of things.For those who don't know the target's priorities, attacking enemy warships is the biggest event a submarine can expect to encounter, and such rare opportunities are as amazing as those found here.Develop.Pacing is deliberate and typical of Ealing, Rank, and British Gaumont studios.

"Gorgeous horror movie. It is dizzy and too scary. The Thing is a remake by John Carpenter. But don't get out of this movie. It is simply amazing. The beginning of the film caused an alien spacecraft to explode toward Earth before humans walked it through the explosion. One of the best opening credits for horror movies. <br /> <br /> The casts of the actors who play the 12-man science team are delighted, and the location of Antartica's station setting is visually impressive. DVD widescreen. It would have been great at the cinema. Kurt Russell excels as a helicopter pilot Macready trying to be the leader of a man trying to fight deadly forms of changing monsters that have infiltrated the base. All the actors in this are really great and they create a great scene of paranoia and tension about who the object is infected with. My favorite scene in the whole movie is nervous, frightening and finally spectacular when Macready still tests everyone alive for infection. I like it because it is fun too. <br /> <br /> A special mention should go to Rob Bottin to find his amazing makeup effects and the aliens' shape-changing design. If you didn't get Oscar for the best visual effects at the time, he should be good. It's debatable whether this is John Carpenter's greatest movie. It is definitely a creepy masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Wait for a cold winter night. Take some Budweiser from the refrigerator and sit down and throw a flame that fights the tower that changes the shape of the flames and mucus.","Brilliant horror movie.It's very gruesome and horrifying.The Thing is a remake of John Carpenter but don't let you down from this movie.It's just amazing.At the beginning of the movie, an alien spaceship sprints toward the earth for centuries before humanity walks on earth, exploding and unleashing the amazingly brilliant movie title of white and blue ""THE THING"". was doing.

"If you like William Hickey in ""Prizzi's Honor"", you can revive your character like Don Anthony from ""Mob Boss"". This is a very weak ""bride"" satire with a little laugh.

"I have seen most, but not all, of the Laurel & Hardy classic movies. I enjoyed the comical comic even after seeing it over and over again. This new film attempts to regain the classics with two new actors similar to Laurel & Hardy, but fails miserably for many reasons. One of them was still out of alignment (still in the early 20th century), but both were described in the 90s. Some of the previous conversations have come back, but they fail miserably even when they get closer to the classic series. This could be the worst movie I've ever seen, and it needs to be pulled off the shelf and locked forever.

"I just gave 10 to Thieves Highway. One of these two reasons is to prove that I am not a child who gives a bad review, but 2 is to fall in love with a woman because the subject of the movie has the same thread. <Br /> <br /> We are all pretty girls and girls movies, but you can't avoid them all, but in the end you will get you. For me pretty girls do two, two terrible terrible things. First it depicts prostitution as a dancer-like job. Absolutely great friends, leg warmers, lots of giggling, knowing to lend each other. You can actually see it in Pretty Woman's prostitute. This is the street prostitute we are talking about. The life we ​​are talking about here is wonderful. She's healthy just by whipping sometimes to explain her predicament. My mood is that this'Happy Hooker' type protagonist is much tastier than an almost realistic character, so if you make a movie about a person's type, but you're too scared of chickens to decorate a player with that trait, you ask a question. Why are you familiar with the role? If you make a movie about a chef, but don't want to talk about cooking or food or wear a white hat, why do you make a movie about a chef first? If you banish a prostitute and turn it into a respectable dancer type, the story completely misses the point, and as a result, it does not fall into any moral and social question that any police may have. <br /> <br /> Secondly,'Pretty Woman' insults romance itself. Edward Lewis, played by Richard Gere, has no clue on how to seduce or romance this'lady' without his plastic friend. Especially when you are stupid in a suit without imagination. Eight out of ten of his romantic moments have to do with flipping cash in any way. It's the Lotus Esprit Turbo that does everything even when he first meets her. The necklace here is where the limousine, money, money, and charm are there? Don't tell me where charisma is and try the piano. <br /> <br /> Girls who like this movie are also girls who like shopping the most. Those who like this movie may not have realized that the old Eddy is less attractive than a calculator. Probably not registered. More importantly. If you like this movie,'Thieves Highway' hates a great story based on the same theme.<br /> <br /> I'll end the song: <br /> <br /> This road is a pretty woman Pretty woman running around, woman I like to treat Pretty woman, I don't believe you You're not the truth No one can spend as much money as you Mercy <br /> <br /> Pretty woman, you are me Don't forgive me Pretty girl, I couldn't help but I saw a pretty girl and you may lack imagination like me. <br /> <br /> Pretty girl, please shop for a while Pretty girl, talk Pretty girl, sell me your smile Pretty girl, yes, yes, yes Pretty girl, look at my way Pretty girl, you join me There will be .. and I will pay you.","I just gave the Thieves Highway a 10, which I mention for two reasons.One is to prove that I'm not a git that gives bad reviews, but two are because the movie theme falls in the same thread, in love with women. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows that Pretty Woman is a flick of a chick, but there is no avoiding everything. Pretty Woman for me does two things, two horrifying and horrifying things.First, I describe prostitution as a career similar To that of a dancer.With absolutely amazing friends, leg warmers laugh a lot and borrow each other.You see a prostitute in Pretty Woman's reality, this is the streetwalker prostitute we are talking about here and has a great life. She is healthy and happy because her occasional whispers alone explain her predicament.My impression is that this ""happy hooker"" type protagonist is much more palatable than real-life characters.If you've made a type of movie and the chicken is so scared that you can' t characterize that player, why do you do it, even i f you're familiar with the role?If I make a movie about the chef but he doesn't want to cook, talk about food, or put on a white hat, why make a movie about the chef first?By salvaging Hooker and turning it into a respectable dancer type, the story completely misses the point, and as a result it may have moral or social questions, what the cop did, really really terrible things.Never be immersed in.<br /> <br /> Second, ""Pretty Woman"" insults the romance itself. Edward Lewis, played by Richard Gere, has no way to seduce or romance this ""woman"" without a plastic friend. It's especially if you're an idiot in a suit without your imagination. Eighteenths of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in some way, it's the Lotus Esprit Turbo that does all the work, even when he first meets her, here Is a diamond necklace, money here and there, money, money, where's your charm? It goes without saying that the charisma lies where the piano is played.<br /> <br /> Girls who like this movi e can also be girls who like shopping. Those who like this movie will not notice that the old Eddie is less attractive than a calculator.More importantly, anyone who likes the movie will hate the ""thief highway"". A wonderful story whose parts are based on the same subject.<br /> <br /> I finish with the song: <br /> <br /> Pretty Woman is hanging out in the street Pretty Woman, the kind of Pretty Woman I like to deal with, II do not believe you You are not true No one could spend like you Pretty woman, can you forgive me Pretty woman, me Had no choice but to look at Pretty Woman, and you might seem as imaginative as I am.<br /> <br /> Pretty Woman, Pretty Woman shopping for a while Woman, talk and pretty woman, sell me a smile Pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah pretty woman, look at my way, pretty woman, say you're with me.

"This movie is undoubtedly a perfect 10/10..

If the action isn't focused on a good story or something like that, you'll find out later when he makes a movie and sees how it compares to other American movies of that time. Jackie Chan's movie has the best fighting scenes and actually a good plot Although it shows, the American movie has a good plot but a slimy action scene compared to what Jackie Chan did at the time. Porn is watching porn, Jackie Chan is watching action. I think you're a smart movie critic and how to rate a good movie. Movie is a movie that can please me. The middle of the movie is boring, but it's very boring, but all action scenes and the rest of the stunts pay for it all.

"I saw a shorter version at the London Film Festival last night. James McNally's summary of the content of the movie is very good.

"It woke me up like waking up the protagonist of this brave movie that woke up from the sleep of life. <br /> <br /> This man, John (Ben Chaplin), leads the banker's ordinary safe life. The surprisingly gorgeous and wild girl To Di Nadia (Nicole Kidman), ordered by email from Russia, goes into life to become a beloved wife by the Jones Plan. But a flaw appears -Nadia doesn't speak words in Johns language. John is calm and emotionless on the outside, but is interested in the beautiful Nadia, so instead of using the full refund policy of the matching service, he buys a dictionary to start the communication process. <br /> <br /> Poor John in the conspiracy was shaken by a decisive thinking activist who woke up from a well-received, safe-feeling clerk, giving the audience a subconscious message, ""You probably did the same."" <br /> <br /> Kidman, Cassel & Kassitzitz make a great team that plays the Russians and are almost indistinguishable from real conversation.

When the end title is displayed, stop watching and feel rather in the middle of the plot and want to watch as soon as the sequel comes. <br /> <br /> My advice is to go out and take this movie immediately and enjoy it. In summary, there are unusual plots, great acting and ideas below the surface. Just like the idea of ​​""rude awakening"" from the artificial, safe daily life of the wheels in the machine of society, the life that the members of the Fight Club want to quit and the machine that Pink Floyd's song sings (""Welcome to the Machine"") !

"Ed Wood is back on board. The fact that the film was made should give hope to young filmmakers who are ambitious.

"This is great and deep casting, but for thrillers it's better to offer more than just naming actors and stories. The first third of the film was conversation and more. Most of it was a lot of women suffering from everything about each other. <br /> <br /> The first 5 actors listed here are women, so make sure they are actually ""chick flick"" and there are few others. Perhaps it will be played on the network for life. <br /> <br /> There was a quick murder scene and more conversation.

In fact, he believes in himself! Will Howard and Emily continue to marry as they wait and observe the case with villagers and journalists all over the world? Or do you know howard is really gay and can't go with that consciousness? This is a great, fun and humane movie about a gay man and his situation. Kline is a gay person who didn't realize, and Kline is wonderful and touching. The rest of the cast entertains the crowd with fiancés mixed with Cusack and stitches like Dillon, Bob Newhart, Debbie Reynolds, and Tom Selleck.

But the insightful, humorous and thoughtful look of the gay population is the best asset of the movie. For those who are upset by gay-themed movies, skip this movie.

"The film took a difficult path, but unfortunately it was downhill when the opening shots were seriously ignoring the American flag. There is also a military adviser who is a U.S. Marine Corps, and it further embarrasses the fact that this amazing protocol and violation of the law were not noticeable. Even more embarrassing is how the Marines reported briefly about the KIA, and then buried in a very short order without some explanation of how they identified the body, even if there was a body. The U.S. government is still discovering what was missing in World War II, and it takes months to identify artifacts. Military shots remain MIA for months or years, and are declared KIA only after the remains have been positively identified or red taped for years. Here we believe it happens within days or weeks. Maybe this happens in Denmark, but not in the United States. Those involved had never had or had minimal respect for the US military. <br /> <br /> A moment when a character can laugh somewhere that makes a punishment. As you struggled to find a motive for such a hog wash, you probably had an extended meeting between actors and actors. It might have been helpful to use a script that works, but it seems to have worked in Cliffs Notes. There is no way to know if the script is horrible, or whether it is a studio or middle-aged child responsible for it in the studio. Either way, this is a terrible film that should never be made.","If the opening shot was a US Marine Corps and you seriously ignored the American flag, there was a tough road ahead of the film, but unfortunately it was a downhill.It is even more confusing that this incredible breach of protocol and law was overlooked, as the military adviser was credited and it was also a clearly retired US Marine.Even more puzzling is that after they briefly explained how the Marines reported the KIA, then a very short order without a slight explanation of how they were identified or whether they were .It is a method filled with.The US government is still finding missing World War II victims, and it will take several months to identify the body. Military shotdowns remain MIA for months or years and are declared KIA if debris is clearly identified or after years of red tape.Here you are expected to believe that it will happen within days or weeks. Maybe this happens in Denmark but not in the United States. Obviously, none of the people involved have ever had a ny involvement or respect for the US military.<br /> <br /> In addition to that, there are many other characters who come up with Ginger out of nowhere and can laugh.There must have been some really extended conferences between actors as They had a hard time finding such a dishwashing motivation.A working script may help, but it seems to have been created on the fly and it works from Cliff Note.There's no way to know if the script was so terrible in the first place, or was it a film director, or the middle-aged children of the responsible studio. Either way, this is a horrifying movie that should never have been made."
"We generally think of England as an expert in rendering the great adventures of the Imperial Age, such as the Four Feathers (1939) and the Zulu, because the Imperial Age was the majority of Britain. Here in the Winds and the Lions we can see a wonderful representation of the American imperial era. Tranquility is committed by the wild, manly nobility of her prisoners, and is disarmed by her beauty and contempt.

"I was looking forward to seeing Dreamgirls for quite some time. And I must say that 1/4 of the movie was good! At that time, it actually depicted a black music scene. But as the movie began, my family and I were bored of our wisdom. The song kept coming. Seriously, if you add just one more music number, it will break with RENT too. <br /> <br /> Also, I have rarely seen any character's character development. I didn't care what happened to them! I knew Eddie Murphy's character should be sad even when he died from overdose, but he couldn't feel the emotions about the character. I gave the characters a faint background for childhood songs and other songs, but my personality wasn't revealed enough to reveal me. With lack of character development. This movie reminded me of a copycat movie based on Ray, Chicago, Rent (Ray and Chicago were great in my opinion). Overall I think this film is best for anyone who is not interested in the whole story, but enjoys a 2 hour fun and entertaining song performance.","I've been looking forward to meeting Dream Girls for quite some time...what is it all about the acclaimed reviews, nominations and media attention.

Songs came one after another. Seriously speaking, it's another music number and using RENT will break it. I didn't care what happened to them! I knew I should be sad when Eddie Murphy's character died from an overdose of drugs, but I didn't feel any emotion in it. The characters were given a weak background, such as their singing voice as a child, but their personality was not revealed and they could not attract me.

"One of Starewicz's longest and weirdest short films is animated by the tears of a girl's longing for the oranges, followed by a toy dog ​​in search of oranges. The dog comes in orange after falling from the back of the car for sale. But when he comes at night, you have to protect the oranges when you enter a demon night club with many bizarre and scary characters. With the help of a plush cat, the dog brought the orange back to the little girl and was saved from a terrible death. The mascot features new skills that have not been seen in Starewicz's films yet. Starewicz's old puppet style has been redesigned with the addition of a live action with a mix of synchronized sound and stop motion animation. The live scene of moving cars and people's feet when a puppet sits on a concrete sidewalk is impressive and fresh. The sound of a small studio was expensive, and Starewicz's use of new technology looked like an old-fashioned hat, so the cries of cars and street vendors are noteworthy. The movie's new doll character is making a terrifying contribution to the evil club scene. Branches and pieces of newspaper are formed. The dead bird's skeleton lays eggs to hatch the skeleton chick. The character flies all over Pat and fans and rocking horses. The new editing technology uses the fast zoom function to speed up scenes slower than before with editing. Starewicz can update his filmmaking style across the board to meet the needs of a new audience making this film one of the best examples of his work.","One of Starewicz's longest and weirdest short films, chase a toy dog ​​in search of orange after being animated by the tears of a girl's mother's longing for orange.

"Nice character development in a pretty cool environment. Being a male, I don't deserve it completely, but from the beginning do a great job of creating a limited Victorian environment. It is not as dark as it really is, and the treatment of women is probably more severe. This is a great chemistry among the main characters. Each has their own ""thing"" to fight them. Once they get out of the rain and out of the cobweb, they start interacting and slowly lose suspicion. What I enjoyed about this movie is that I didn't go to a cheap comedy when I could have a movie. He did not try to teach us. People who seem completely merit are very well-developed human beings who can see light. The character Alfred Molina had a bit of a hard time experiencing the Epiphany so quickly, but there was something going on in this world. Positive things happen in the lives of pretty good people and they act well around them.","Nice character development in a pretty cool environment.Being a man, I don't think I'm fully qualified to understand it, but from the start it does a great job of establishing a restricted Victorian environment.It wasn't as pessimistic as It was, and the treatment of women was probably even more severe.Achieving this is a wonderful chemistry between key characters.Each has its own ""things"" they work on.When they come out of the rain and get out of the spider web, They begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of doubt.What I enjoyed with this movie was that it didn't work, even if there was a cheap comedy.

"Prussic gas, a murderer in a red clansman suit, a white whip-wielding hood, and the murder of an abusive schoolgirl are hidden in an office with an aquarium of turtles and fish enlisted by a mysterious ruler enlisted in a mysterious price. The Scottish Higs (IJoachim Fuchsberger) and his prominent Siegfried Schürenberg inspector are definitely touching the case. It seems to be centered on student and Portland (Uschi Glas), who inherits a lot of wealth at the age of 21. The targeted girls share a room with Anne, but the reason for the murder remains SY's greatest mystery. All of the girls' dorm staff seem to be hiding, and certain members of the faculty are talented enough to accurately strangle the necks of people who fall into prey and attack with a whip in a red monk gown disguise. The two prisoners were commissioned to use the newly generated toxic gas while exchanging money with a creature created by a scientist killed at the beginning of the movie by a mysterious man. Greaves (Günter Meisner) This is a clever plan for drivers to meet a prisoner (.. hiding in a barrel) with the help of a corrupt guard. Blindfolded into the secret room of Master Mind, who gives orders on who and how to kill. Revealing this operation is a top priority for Sir Higgins and Sir John, and explains the truths they seek regarding the murder case and why it happened. I suspect the female dorm principal, the author's brother, a sweaty, very tense chemistry teacher, a snooping gardener, and a vanister. Some are red herring until discarded, throwing viewers each time until the real owner spirit is found. There are a number of distortions in the ending. <br /> <br /> Of the Krimi movies I've seen, COLLEGE GIRL MURDERS is a brilliant killer, a complex plot that produces many surprises and potential suspects, and college students in adults and dorms. I think James Bond can see James Bond's impact on certain creamy movies where gas is fired when a crocodile pit, a villain ruler's secret hideout (unused), fake bible/water pistol is opened. Surprisingly, the faces of the victims, Greaves' Royles Royce, has a clasp that darkens the window without revealing passengers in the backseat and drills a hole used to watch the girl while swimming in the room. Many may consider the responsibility of Sir John's rugged and spoiled behavior and how often he undermines Higgins' ability to reach the truth. I felt that he was used as a comedy slogan. In particular, I felt as I tried to misunderstand his words by psychoanalyzing suspects and potential victims. Higgins follows clues/facts using techniques adopted as investigators for many years and often avoids respect as much as possible. The humming pace of Alfred Vohrer's credible pace, the script is full of fun characters and great content. The fact that many adults around the dormitory are suspected is someone who wields a whip or shoots behind the executions of the murdered girls. I'm saying this may be one of the best examples of the Crimea genre -opening (.., even","Conviction paid by the hands of crustacean gas, a white-whip murderer in a red clan suit and hood, and a mysterious mastermind hiding his face in an office with an aquarium of turtles and fish.The killing of a female college student who received it .

It feels used as a comedy remedy, especially in an attempt to psychologically analyze Suspects and potential victims.It was Higgins uses the skills he's employed over the years as an investigator, instead looking for clues/facts and avoiding John as much as possible.Reliable Alfred Vohrer teaches at a pace you can, hum the pace steadily, and the screenplay is full of interesting characters and interesting content.The fact that many adults in the dormitory were suspicious also led some to whip or shoot behind the executions of the girls who had one of them killed.This may be one of the best (if not the best) example of the Krimi genre.It's always another ace as you keep guessing.The last revelation unearthed is very eye-catching.-opening (.. and you even get the literal unmask of the real Mastermind pulling all the strings up)."
"A few days ago, I was very lucky to see this film as part of the Melbourne International Film Festival 2005. I have to admit that I am very partial to movies that focus on relationships, especially those that focus on the tragic side of life. I also like most of the Scandinavian filmmaking, and there is a particularly deep quality in the way the story unfolds and the character is drawn. The characters in this film are excellent in detail and depth. Nevertheless, despite the fact that we meet very personal situations and very many people in our community. After the screening, the audience was very quiet and locked. I am still playing some of those scenes in my mind and I am still amazed by their power and meaning.","I was very lucky to see this film as part of the Melbourne International Film Festival 2005 just a few days ago.I have to admit that I am very biased towards relationships-focused films, especially those that focus on the tragic side of life.

"This movie is really bad. Most likely it was shot in a park or basement. There is a giant spider, but all we see is one leg. There is a worm that lives in a cave, a cheap sock puppet with corrugated teeth. And the conspiracy is a jumbo jumbo after the end that doesn't make any sense. Everything can just laugh.","This movie is really bad.It seems that most of them were shot in parks and basements.There are giant spiders, but we see only one leg.Some worms that live in the cave are only cheap sock dolls with cardboard teeth.And the plot is a bunch of post-apocalyptic mambo jumbo with absolutely no meaning.The whole thing just laughs."
I think this is a hell of a movie............. We can see Steven fighting back with his martial arts stuff and like all Segal movies there are messages without messages. It's one of many action/fighting movies but the message makes segal movies great and special,"I think this is one hell of a movie........you can see Stephen fight again with his martial arts material, and like all Seagull movies, there is a message ,One of many action/fighting movies without a message , a message is what makes a Seagull movie great and special."

Anyway, I thought it was one of the more vivid, realistic and beautiful friendship movies. How far will you go for your best friend?

"It was memorable that Reese Witherspoon first appeared on the big screen. She looks like a new face with a slightly clean, sticky but sturdy, reweened face. <br /> <br /> I always liked her as an actor, and I didn't know she started this youth with a career. I was actually respected by Reese to know who she was early. I seemed to have her own character who lived with the character whenever she watched her performance, and whenever the character was portrayed so far. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my first movie experience with Reese was the Little Red Riding Hood parody. Reese was with Kiefer Sutherland.","It was impressive that Reese Witherspoon first went out on the big screen.

"This game is ranked higher than anything so far. The graphics were really good as I was honored to play my game on PS2. The voice actor was above standard. Difficulty is correct.

"This movie is not worth it. If you want to see this kind of stuff, see a Hollywood movie! This is completely a shame about the Bollywood name. Neil N Nikki sucks seriously! Do not watch this movie. As for the actors, the behavioral genes seem to have skipped generations. Tanisha couldn't be worn less, and Uday Chopra was definitely chosen because he is the director's spoiled son. (All Halla Le were surprisingly dumb.) I hope the director won't spend a lot of money because the song is young. In conclusion, I hated movies. Don't let your kids see it, and if you're at your house it's a stupid movie so drop it! Purchase a CD if necessary. (As I said, the song is uh.) At least it's better than a movie.","This movie is not worth anything.So if you want to see this sort of thing, switch to Hollywood movies!This is a total shame for the Bollywood name.Neil N.

"This is another western side of the greedy cattle baron trying to push down small ranchers and farmers. Surely everything was done before and after. But The Violent Men is special. <br /> <br /> What makes it special is to act as a fox, as Barbara Stanwyck often did in her late films. She's married here to the livestock baron, Wrinkled Edward G. Robinson, but there is a hint that Robinson is wrinkled and can injure him with an injury. Regardless of Barbara, where her daughter-in-law Brian Keith is meeting their needs. Diane Foster, daughter of Robinson and Stan Week, or Rita Milan, Keith's Mexican girlfriend, don't get along well. <br /> <br /> The unfaithful subplots dominate the film, but Glen Ford comes to the west to keep his little war rancher, a civil war veteran, in good health. He is a quiet western hero who makes the mistake of being pushed too often by people once. We expect Wild Bill Elliott's famous words to come out of Ford's mouth. ""I am a peaceful person."" <br /> <br /> The 50's was the age of adult western, and the subject went into a horse opera that had not been explored before. The following year Glenn Ford will do another West, Jumal, one of which is exploring negation as a conspiracy component. <br /> <br /> Traditional Western stuff is enough and a soap opera for violent men.","This is another west about the greedy baron of the bull who is trying to get rid of small ranchers and farmers.It certainly did all that before and since.But violent men are special.<br /> <br /> What's special is that Barbara Stanwick plays the role of Vixen, as he did in later films. She is married here to crippled Edward G. Robinson, a baron of cows, but there are some hints that Robinson is crippled and his injuries may have made him powerless.Regardless of Barbara, whose brother-in-law Brian Keith meets his needs.It doesn't work either for Robinson and Stanwick's daughter, Diane Foster, or for Keith's Mexican girlfriend, Rita Milano.<br /> <br /> Infidelity subplot takes over most of the film, but Glenford is a Civil War veteran, a solid little rancher, because his health keeps himself here. Come to the west.

This would be very true for violent men.<br /> <br /> The fifties were the age of adulthood in the West, and the theme was incorporated into an unexplored horse opera.

"This movie was really pathetic. There were no poor scenarios and stories, so three losers sank the bikini lady. Sometimes I felt like I was watching an episode of Beavis and Butthead. I couldn't watch the whole movie. Emran Hashmi is disappointed and Hrshitta Bhatt is not at all impressive. Celina Jaitley was not bad. The only valuable part of the film is Anu Malik's camouflage and his obsession with shayaris. It was quite fun. The song ""Sini Ne"" and the remix version were really good. You can always rely on Chart Buster to Emran Lip Lock and Lip Sync. After all, Emran doesn't seem to have a good script from Bhatts to back him up this time.","This movie was absolutely pathetic.The pathetic screenplay and lack of story saw three losers drool on a baby in a bikini.From time to time, I felt like I was watching an episode of Beavis and Butthead.I couldn't see the whole movie .Emran Hashmi was disappointed, and Hrshitta Bhatt isn't quite impressive.

"The film fails miserably at all levels. I have an idea. Send everyone who participated in this movie to a hot zone in the Middle East. With luck, everyone can be shot and killed, and no need to waste time again. Did you mention that you have never written about a pile of garbage like a movie all your life?

"Yes, before commenting, this film is incredibly underrated. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is Like Glass, Morrissey, Catherine Trammell's role is great.

"Based on Edgar Rice Burrows' novel, AT THE EARTH'S CORE provides the means to escape the brain and relax. Victorian scientist Dr. Abner Perry (Peter Cushing) invented a huge landlord, and he and his American partner (Doug McClure) use it to go deeper and deeper to explore the mysterious land. They soon discover the world of lost subhuman creatures that collide with prehistoric monsters. Instead of a daring adventurer, he is desperate. McClure, on the other hand, exaggerated himself enough to laugh. Caroline Munro plays Dia, a pretty princess who refuses to leave her world near the center of the earth.

"This show is absolutely meaningless. Every week, two women go to real estate to do gardening.

"This movie was so bad. For a while I thought I was actually watching a parody of a bad movie. The ""clipper gigan"" scene at the end laughed until the inside was hurt. This script was terrible, but it was combined with Sean Young's terrible acting. It's a classic movie that's especially not worth seeing, while detailing all the plots (done with a flashback) while hanging from a cliff! In fact, the fake scene in this scene reminded me of the Edwood movie. I still can't believe how this happened. First of all, how did such a bad script get green light?

"Meryl Streep is such a genius. Well, at least as an actress. I know she was made fun by playing a lot of roles with accents, but she cuts the accents every time. Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was inspiring. The Chamberlain depicted here was not particularly desirable. But this makes Streep's work more prominent. I think she's worth 10 points as an Oscar nominee. There were two interesting things about the movie. I don't know much about Australia, but the topic of religious prejudice among the general public played a big role in the story. When I first saw a movie a few years ago, I missed this a lot. But it came out loud and clear yesterday. And the Australian press seems to have achieved chasing and excesses of chasing misery like American colleagues. Pretty good movie. It is a little different. Grade:B","Meryl Streep is such a genius. Well, at least as an actress.I know she's teased by playing many roles in accents, but she nails accents every time.

"The ""social commentary"" of racism and prison conditions in the southern rural areas of the 1970s, ""Nightmare"" is probably full of bad southern stereotypes, with phonemes highlighted. Not only does it offend most Americans' sensibility, this stupid work comes from a thinly disguised ""jailed baby"" movie, especially the original, uncut version. Nevertheless, acting is generally above average, and in particular, Chuck Connors does a great job that makes viewers dislike him, even if it seems somewhat uncomfortable in several scenes. It also has a role of change that seems to be Robert Reed's ecstatic warden, and Tina Lewis (formerly Ginger of ""Gilligan's Island"") has created a somewhat reliable Guardian Prison. <br /> <br />","Perhaps the ""social commentary"" on the rural racism and prison conditions of the 1970s, ""Nightmare"" is full of southern stereotypes and audible accents. Not only unpleasant to the sensibilities of most Southern Americans, this annoying piece, especially in the raw original version, falls out as a simply disguised ""Prison Babe"" movie. Nevertheless, acting is generally above average, especially late Chuck Connors does a good job of making viewers hate him.

"Now, here's a great example of filmmaking in the 70s! ""What is Helen's problem?"" The basic premise of shocking and confusing but comes in a stylish and stylish way! In the hands of other filmmakers, this clearly became an unpleasant exploitation story, but along with director Curtis Harrington (""Who's Slutty Aunt Lou?"") and screenwriter Henry Farrell (""Hush...Hush...Sweet Charlotte""), it's a subject and genre. It has become a beautiful and almost fascinating mixture. The movie's basic plot is definitely terrible, but it's a love story, a 1930s swing vibe, songs and tap dancing, and much more! What makes this movie original is undoubtedly the setting. We literally date back to the 1930s with a wonderful depiction of the music, religion, theater business and wardrobe of that era. Following a long and exhausting trial in which his sons were sentenced to death and imprisonment, Debbie Reynolds and Helen Winters fled to California to start a new life running a dance school for young talented girls. Adelle in particular falls in love with a local millionaire and perfectly adapts to the new environment, but the poor Helen continues to sink into the spiral of madness and paranoia. She listens to the preacher's nagging, fears punishment for the crimes committed by her son, and fears to slowly develop violent tendencies. It's not completely flawless, but the script is well written and the movie speed is moderate. The song, tap dancing, and tango sequences have expanded considerably and have little to do with the actual plot, but there are never boring moments in ""Helen's Problem"". But the atmosphere continues to blaze, and the film clearly benefits from Shelly Winters' great acting performance. She is an unpredictable, introverted woman who will take less than two seconds, especially looking more colorful than all Freddy Krugers, Jayne Bock, Ecle Myers combined for the last 10 minutes or so. Sadly, there are some great advocates who sadly weaken and weaken their potential a bit, like the prominent visitors to a subtle MacLiammóir-like persecution teacher, Agnes Moorehead and a creepy priestess, and Timothy Carey. Grand Guignol fanatics have surprisingly terrifying scenes and moments of real shock, but especially set pieces and costume design (Oscar nominations) are breathtaking.","Now, this is another great example of the awkward 70s filmmaking. The basic premise of ""What is Helen's problem?"" is quite shocking and disturbing, but it is presented in such a stylish and sophisticated way! In the hands of other film crews, this was certainly a story of awkward and gritty exploitation, but directed by Curtis Harrington (""Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?"") and screenwriter Henry Farrell ( ""Hush...Hush...Sweet Charlotte""), it was a beautiful, almost captivating mix of themes and genres. The movie's basic vision is definitely terrifying, but there's plenty to experience in love stories, the swaying 1930s mood, songs and tap dance. The settings definitely make this movie very unique. We literally go back to the 1930s and sublimely portray the music, religion, theater industry and wardrobe of that era. Adele (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Sherry Winters) fled to California after a long and exhausted trial condemning their son for murder, running a dance school for talented young girls Trying to start a new life. Adele, in particular, falls in love with the local millionaire, so he fully adapts to the new environment, but the poor old Helen continues to sink in a downward spiral of madness and paranoia. She listens to the ramblings of radio evangelists, fearing being punished for the crimes committed by her son, and slowly developing violent tendencies. The script is not completely flawless, but it is well written and the movie is well-tuned. There's never a dull moment in ""The Helen Problem"", but the sequence of songs, tap dances, and tango is quite expanded and has little to do with the actual plot. But the atmosphere is always ominous, and the movie definitely benefits from the excellent acting performances of Sherry Winters. She's an unpredictable introverted woman, especially for the last ten minutes or so, which seems more petrified than Freddy Kruegers, Jason Voorhees, and Michael Myers combined, so I'm really scared! Sadly, there are some great support characters who are a little underdeveloped and deprived of their potential. For example, Michelle McClairwar as a cheeky eloquent teacher, Agnes Moorehead as an eerie priestess, and Timothy Carey as an intrusive visitor to a woman's house. Some of us have some astonishingly tragic scenes and real shocking moments that Grand Guignol fanatics will enjoy, but especially the set pieces and costume designs (even if nominated by the Oscar! ) Is breathtaking."
"Resnais, wow! The genius who brought us to Hiroshima Mon Amour challenges us to make French musicals in the 1930s vivid colors. The opening voiceover with old and decorated intertitles was a nice touch. The camera aperture (like an old hand crank) then opens at the black and white aperture. The camera cools down or rather suddenly displays surprisingly colorful colors in an elegant table set for a tea party. All this is the first 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then the music starts.

"The film plots the sci-fi movie ""Doppelganger"" (the astronauts of Earth colliding against'the other side of the Earth' on the other side of the sun and the Cold War totalitarian atmosphere of the world) and pilots of the TV series, but everything sinks without a trace And the TV would be better. <br /> <br /> Anyone here is perfectly suited for'made for TV'.

"Black comedy is not always an easy sale. You can get a black comedy with great success, for example Fargo. However, in general, they do not find a large audience.

The resulting behavior is often very interesting and even tart. It is never dull and often full of surprises. Crystal is as good as he can, and DeVito has always been underrated as an actor. The film usually relies on a fairly large number of physical comedies that work painfully.

"Paul Verhoeven's predecessor to his strike hit'Basic Instinct' is a stylish and shocking Neo Noir thriller. Verhoeven became famous in his hometown of the Netherlands and the United States for making rather jolly garbage films, which is one of the reasons. The fourth one follows Gerard Reve's strange story (played by Jeeroen Krabbé). Gay, alcoholic and slightly crazy writer going to Vlissingen to talk about the story he wrote. While there, he meets the fascinating Christine Hall Slag (Rene Sutten Dick), takes her to her home, discovers a great picture of one of her lovers, and declares she will meet him even if he kills him. <br /> <br /> Paul Verhoeven has distorted the truth many times in this film, which gives him no idea where he is. Much of what happens in The Fourth Man may look like they look, but they can easily be interpreted as completely different, which keeps the audience on the edge of the seat for a duration and makes the movie work like this story. is. Paul Verhoeven is not a filmmaker who thinks he needs to restrain himself, and that's one of my favorites. The film features a very shocking scene and I feel sick for hours after that (not very often!). I won't spoil it because it needs a surprise factor... but you can see what it means when watching a movie (get an uncut version!). There are other horrible scenes that are less shocking than I mentioned, but they are lovely nonetheless. One man was eaten by a lion, the other sent a pipe through his skull, and the ship was broken in half... <br /> <br /> The fourth man's acting wasn't good for the house. But overall it is solid. Jeroen Krabbé captures the attention of the audience and acts as a drunken writer. But the most striking thing with the feminine fate at the center of the story is Renée Soutendijk. Her performance was modeled after Sharon Stone as a basic instinct nine years later, but the original fate did the best. Paul Verhoeven helps to create a mystery of the story, drawing our attention through numerous perspectives. Verhoven continued to make trash, but it's definitely talented, and it's a shame not to use it better. Of all the Verhoeven movies I've seen, this is the best, and it might be difficult to meet. Believe me, it is worth trying.","The predecessor of Paul Verhoeven's breakout hit ""Basic Instinct"" is a stylish and stunning neo-noir thriller. Verhoven became known for making a rather dirty trash movie, both in his native Holland and the United States. This movie is one of the reasons. Force Man is following the strange story of Gerard Rave (played by Jeroen Clave). Homosexual, a little mad writer with alcoholism. Go to Vlissingen and talk about the story he wrote. While there, he met the enchanting Kristin Halslag (Renesotendijk) and took him home, discovering a handsome photo of one of his lovers, even if it killed him. I declare to meet you. <br /> <br /> Paul Verhoeven has twisted the truth many times in this movie. This prevents you from knowing exactly where you are. Much of what happened at Forceman might seem like they were, but they could easily be interpreted as something completely different, which would entice the spectator to the edge of their seat during that period. Keep it in and also make the movie act as this story is what it thrives on. Paul Verhoeven is not a filmmaker who feels he needs to be restrained. That is one of my favorite things about him. The movie features a very shocking scene that will keep you sick for hours (it doesn't happen that often!). Don't mess with it as the surprise factor needs to work... but the film tells me what I mean (get the uncut version!). Other, less shocking than the ones I have mentioned, there are still some beautiful scenes. A man is eaten by a lion, another man is piped through his skull, and the boat is crushed in half... nice. <br /> <br /> Acting as a Forceman is not something you write at home, but it's solid overall. Jeroen Clave has attracted the attention of the audience and looks like a drunken writer. The most striking woman's fate at the heart of the story is Rene Soutendijk. Her performance was mimicked by Sharon Stone nine years later at the Basic Instinct, but the original fate was at its best. The direction is consistent, as Paul Verhoeven directs us from different perspectives to help create the mystery of the story. Verhoeven keeps throwing garbage, but he's clearly talented and it's a shame he doesn't use it well. Of all the Verhoeven movies I've seen, this is the best and it may be hard to meet. Believe me, it's worth the effort."

"There is a difference between ""movie"" and ""movie"". Regardless of quality, the movie is ready for public use. The movie is to make a camcorder with a group of friends over the weekend. As a viewer, I have seen both examples. <br /> <br /> On September 19th, I attended the screening of ""Donnybrook"" by writer/director Jon Satejowski. Now when you read the script and see two different cuts of this work (rough cut and ""finished"" product) you can say it's a movie. And student movies. It is competent because there are no better words. In other words, the director knew how to record on the camera and capture the video. In most cases, the visual effects are static and not impressive, and the conversation scene is mostly reduced to long shots, with little or no close-up shots to help the audience establish a relationship with the character. I understand that this is a moderately budgeted movie, but some visual sense will be appreciated and I have gone a long way to get the audience's attention. <br /> <br /> The limited camera work has shown that it can be done with well-written and exciting stories and a few sharp conversations. Steven Soderbergh's ""Sex, Lies and Videotapes"" comes to mind immediately. But not in this movie. The main story is weak and out of focus. If the main conspiracy is David trying to fix his relationship with his father, this movie seems to have missed the point. What I've got is David's main aspiration: ""changing the face of a rock and roll."" However, we do very little to show this. At first there is a sequence of dreams and at the end his improvisation, but what we get is that David listens to music or plays the guitar casually. We heard Davie performed a lot, but didn't see him completely in lockout mode. Next, don't talk to the audience. Anyone who has taken a creative writing class knows this. Also, David doesn't look like a big guy in the Glam Rock era of the 1970s. He seemed more comfortable in the early days of Rock'n' Roll, posing as James Dean's less talented brother. In the meantime, the rest of the movie events seem to occur randomly to random cliche characters, and story threads that have little to do with the slim main story are raised and abandoned at surprising frequencies (e.g. related subplots). Terry's father) If you want to watch a movie of this kind of accidental structure, you might consider watching ""Napoleon Dynamite"" again. In the scene I think I should mention that they are very few. Is there too much to ask for a speaker? I don't think so. This is a short and uneven sentence, as the characters say. An insightful question, an angry profanity, or a violent explosion occurred. These characters simply don't behave like ordinary and rational people. It's Al Hudson's who can use this kind of material to see why there's one good performance in a movie because he's not doing well with Sam Elliott's imitation while spending time on the screen. Anyone who is ready for the challenge of a great director or feature director could have found these problems and allowed the writer and camera personnel to solve them. But when Satejowski gets too close to the ingredients, he simply won't see them, or he won't take the necessary steps to fix the problem, because otherwise it could spoil the creative vision. Being unable to deal with criticism in a constructive way or being unwilling is a sign of self-indulgence, a misguided fool. Please contact Rob Schneider. <br /> <br /> Eventually, we left Zach Braff's remarkable ""Garden State"" poor high school set, two films with a much more remarkable ""Velvet Goldmine"". Worthy of time. <br /> <br /> Now, before the cast or crew comes out of the word work to start working on this review, I'll suggest this. The best I can do is make my own movie and praise Mr. Satejowski who is ambitious for the audience to see. However, the hope that this film will be picked up and distributed is simply a dignified vision. This is a student movie.

"Sometimes you have to be patient when you see indie fear. If you can tap the slow-paced early scenes, sometimes a real gem appears... Unfortunately, ""Satan's Whip"" wasn't. <br /> <br /> Handwriting ""Satan's Whip"" directed by Jason Maran tries to attract us at the boring snoring festival of the movie. I guess black and white (and blue) shooting might have been the reason, but it didn't explain why most of the blood is blue, and it turned out to be more annoying as the film progressed. The story itself is not that bad, and in fact there was originality and decent content, but acting is pathetic. This progresses slowly and I forgot ""Satan's Whip"" very quickly due to the lack of real (red). I will give a ""4"" rating for witty conversations.","Sometimes, when you're watching an indie horror, you just have to have a patient.

"How to defile kibbutz's life <br /> <br /> This film is not a cultural story about a boy's life in kibbutz, but it is usually about kibbutz's intentional demonization. During the first two minutes of the movie, a milker in charge of cattle rapes one of the calves. And it's all downhill from the character's point of view, which represents a typical ""kibbutznikim"". In addition to the two main characters, clinically depressed woman and her young son, everyone else in Kibbutz is a malicious caricature. <br /> <br /> This story, like a kind of cult, focuses on how kibbutz slowly despairs mother and son and inevitably follows. In this kibbutz, there is no happiness, no joy, no laughter. All personalities/situations represent other terrible human malice like misogyny, hypocrisy, violence, cultism, oppression, etc. For example, the protagonist is a surprisingly handsome European 12 He is a boy to live-his older brother is his typical kibbutz youth. ""Jewish"" physical appearance and brutal character. He is more interested in tightening foreign volunteers than the health of his dying mother. He treats these volunteers like garbage. His younger brother quoted after begging for a visit to his dying mother, whom he had not seen for a long time due to military service. ""Linda, go shower and send the semen in 2 minutes."" <br /> <br /> In this movie, there is a European foreigner who plays his mother's boyfriend. When the animal rapist tries to hit the mother's son, the boyfriend breaks the rapist's arm and defends him. He was kicked out of the kibbutz to take ""violent"" action against one of them. More Hypocrisy: An incredibly annoying French woman acting as a schoolteacher can't have sex before age 18 or is unconvincing without love and has to be humorous to the audience, but it actually explains stupid behavior. . In the field of tightening a young boy's mother when he falls, he is tightening the kibbutz's head. <br /> <br /> The movie depicts kibbutzim as a kind of cult. In the middle of the night, the children yan body in bed and are transferred from the field overseen by the elders of the kibbutz to the swearing of the allegiance. Obviously the mother can't ""escape"" the kibbutz, but in reality, anyone can get in and out as they please. It is a mystery how the boy's father died, but Kibbutz's surviving parents who ""followed him"" are ruthless and miserable, weighing on their mother and son. <br /> <br /> This is the gist of the film. The kibbutz's life is ""not suitable"" for one-dimensional characters that are fatal, miserable and fatal for people, dramatization, sturdy performances, and cunning messages. I am sorry for the person who made this movie. I have never been raised in kibbutzim.

This is A European alien who plays her mother's boyfriend.When an animal rapper tries to attack his mother's son, his boyfriend breaks his arm to protect him. He was immediately expelled from Kibbutz and subsequently behaved ""violently"" against one of the Kibbutz members. More hypocrisy : An insanely annoying French woman acting as a school teacher explains that sex can't happen by the age of 18 or without love, explaining the actual act that should be humorous to the audience.

"Clifton Webb is one of my favorites. However, Mr Scout Master is not one of his best. The role of his patented curmudgeon seems fun and rather unpleasant. The film itself is overflowing with silly emotions. It also contains numerous references to religious beliefs and American patriotism. Clifton Webb does its best with poor scripts. Edmund Gwenn acts as another delightful priest and takes no action. The child actor Reid is played by a talented child who has a flat effect on the entire film. His only claim to fame as an actor is probably a low voice like a bullfrog, unusual for someone of his age. But once you've heard it, you don't have to listen again. Unfortunately he occupies most of the movie. I'm so annoyed that this child quickly moves forward whenever he appears. Since he has a lot of scenes in this movie, this means fast-moving many movies. There were many talented children's actors, and it is a pity that this film does not contain any of them. Nevertheless, the Clifton Webb in traditional wide brim hats and shorts is worth a look.","Clifton Webb is one of my favorites. However, Mr Scout Master is not one of his best. His patented role of curmudgeon seems to be more obligatory and even offensive than fun. The movie itself is full of mawkish sentiment. In addition, viewers are presented with a number of handy references to faith and American patriotism that break away as harsh rather than genuine. Clifton Webb does his best with poor screenplay. Edmund Gwen plays yet another hilarious clergy and is given nothing to do. The child actor lead is played by an untalented child who shows a flat influence throughout the movie. Obviously, fame as a performer is a low bullfrog-like voice rare to those of his age. But once you hear it, you've heard it so you don't have to hear it again. Unfortunately, he makes up the majority of the movie scene. This kid is so frustrated that I fast forward every time he appears. This means that I fast forward a lot of the movie, as he has a lot of scenes in this movie. There were many talented child actors. It's a pity that this movie contains nothing. Still, Clifton Webb in a traditional wide-brimmed hat and shorts is worth a visit."

"The world's message about the crisis of war is ignored by the public. In 1940, the mythical city, Everytown, typically represents England, but can represent any country in the world. When war finally approaches, the devastation continues until the destruction of Everytown by 1966, not five years. In addition to the devastation and toll on humanity, ""Wandering Sickness"" is another epidemic that lasts another four years. <br /> <br /> ""What is coming"" is a hope for a resurrected civilization that balances the deadly and future-oriented worldview in which science stands out. Spokesman Cabal (Raymond Mash) is devoted to his business without being shaken by his mission, but the concept of “the world's wings” gives a bit of a rough feeling. If he fails, others will follow. This message continues to strengthen throughout the film, returning persuasively after the hourly movie speech. The human need to test the limits of knowledge and achievement requires a ""all universe or nothing"" mindset. <br /> <br /> The film's automation and mechanical image in the second half of the film is a great silent movie ""reminiscent of a metropolis."" "". As Everytown was rebuilt and transformed by 2036, the sight of the city's rebirth strikes a resonant chord as today's modern city architecture suggests that the movie's terrible prophetic vision is realizing.""

People are at risk of being swept away by forces beyond their control.","The message of the world on the brink of war is ignored by the public.Despite the mysterious city of 1940, Everytown generally represents the United Kingdom, it can withstand any country in the world.When the war finally arrives, it will continue to be destroyed until 1966 rather than another five years.At that time, Everytown is completely destroyed.In addition to the devastation and sacrifice of humanity, there are “wandering diseases” and plagues that last for another four years.<br /> <br / > ""Things to Come"" balances both deadly and futuristic worldviews. Hope for a revived civilization. The concept of ""Wings Over the World"" is a little solid, but spokesman Kabal (Raymond Massey) is unwavering in his mission and devoted to his cause .If he fails, the others will follow.This message was continually strengthened throughout the film and was convincingly brought back at the end of Massey's film speech.The insatiable need of humans to test the limits of knowledge and achievement. requires the notion of ""all universes or nothing"".<br /> <br /> The latter half of the film's automation and mechanical images are reminiscent of the great silent film ""Metropolis"""" as Todaytown was rebuilt and transformed by 2036, a modern city of today.The city's revitalization scene resonates with the resonating chords as the architecture of the movie suggests that the film's eerie prophetic vision bears fruit.The film makes a mistake by 67, the human's first mission to the Moon, but in 1936, the 100-year timetable seemed more legitimate than 1969.<br /> <br /> ""Things to Come"" is a rareness in the movie, a picture that reminds you.

"? Fulch.. This man brings one of the arrogant and weird movies he's made so far. Answer:!. Yes The cat in the brain, also known as the Nightmare Concert, is Fulch's last masterpiece. Yes, no matter what people say about it. There is not. There is little reason why this movie is one of the best Fulci movies. <br /> <br /> Fulci makes himself and his films fun with this movie. The lead roll for this film is not Fulci himself. He's a horror-fighting director who thinks he's slowly getting into trouble. It is full of black humor, unlike most modern horror movies. Being a Fulci movie, you should know that it should be boring. How much? Well I always liked Gore in the movies and I didn't get enough of it, but I believe the cat in the brain is actually hard to stop and keep thirst for Gore. Even Brain Dead did not stop. CITB is everything. Almost every scene is related to Fulci, and after being hypnotized by *khmmm* evil psychiatrists, he sees all sorts of horror about everything that happens to him or everything he sees. Some scenes saw rotten bodies lying on the floor instead of accidentally dropping whiskey. Then the wound starts to bleed a little. Forget Beyond or Zombie 2 Now Fulci loves how to apply all the cartoon parts to the Gore Fest movie. He is a great director. Interesting moments and lines sometimes occur, or many plot holes, as Fulci said, ""Gore filmmaking is a kind of bottle."" If Fulci is fun, be sure to check it out. If the above is weak, avoid this and repeat ""movie only"" ps. Some of the Gore scenes from this movie: chainsaw disassembly (full), tearing of the tongue, tearing of the eye, maggot-infected bodies, zombies, beheading, dents in boiling water, stabbing in the shower (head), throat slits, body and organs Many of them are toasted sideways","Khrushi...

Well pretty.I always liked gusset in movies and couldn't get enough of it, but the cat in the brain actually stopped gusset thirst, and believing me, it's hard to archive is.Even Braindead didn't stop it.CITB is all gusset.Almost all scenes about Fulci seeing all sorts of fear for everything that happens to him or everything that he sees after b eing hypnotized by an evil psychiatrist in *khmmm* Is related.In some scenes, whiskey was accidentally dropped, and instead, a rotting carcass lay on the floor, oozing from the wound.Forget Beyond or Zombie 2.

"The movie's incomprehensible confusion. After the police are shot, they extract the bullets from themselves, put them in a glass bottle in the bathroom (at the size of a bottle that has been shot about 50 times so far), and about a top secret tank protected by 5 to 6 people for any reason. Incompetent soldier driving into Mexico. It is never clear whether they were intentionally sent there or really lost. And you won't even hear another scenario feature called ""butthorn"". Gary Busey tries to play Mel Gibson in ""Lethal Weapon"" and Busey is a serviceable actor, but the film ruined the whole ordinary film. William Smith is once again a Russian soldier, like he did in ""Red Dawn"" a few years ago. After gravity on most bikers in the 70s, it was good to broaden his range of communist hollowing. Sadly, he will always be best remembered as someone Clint Eastwood can do ""in any way"".","What a mysterious mess of the movie.About the cops, I take the bullet out of myself after firing and store it in a glass jar in the bathroom (and because of the size of the jar that has been hit about 50 times so far) , the best protected by 5 or 6 Confidential tank An incompetent soldier who has driven it into Mexico for some reason.It is not clear if they were sent there intentionally or if they really got lost.

"warning:. The review included minors <br /> <br /> Two years ago, I saw the first five films in the franchise, and the entire Elm St. I was planning an overview of the series, but in just 2 years I realized I couldn't remember enough about them to do it -. I don't think they could have made a lot of impressions From what I remember, some of the sequels (especially Dream Warriors) weren't as bad as they were often created, but even the original wasn't classic. As, the predictability of the premise (if people fall asleep and are killed in a dream) is not suitable for the tension of the story. But I can't remember much of the first 5 movies, but I know that I haven't fallen into the depths of Freddie's death. <br /> <br /> The indication of how sick Freddie is at this point is the fact that the film was only promoted for the character's death. The conclusion of the film is not hidden, but actually the whole purpose of the film's existence is to explain how empty, spiritless and cynical this venture was. <br /> <br /> Robert Englund's charismatic child molestation is causing laughter. I always thought Freddy's mockery of 10 victims wasn't aimed at the character more than the teenage audience who could have seen this trip. Englund said, ""I know this is garbage, but you are paying to see it. So who laughs?"" And victims of child abuse are such insensible .? Seeing the description will hurt your mind. Is Freddie's appearance in the movie always so rudimentary that he can do it here? ""haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr-har-har-hars"" is the only Elm St. you've ever seen If it is a movie, you will never know the character. It's ironic that Engde's characters in the backfire dictionary pretend to play Englund as a boo-hiss pantomime villain along with the slopes of the crossing (i.e. not exaggerated or misplaced, but not at all fun). <br /> <br /> Universally poor. Watch how many times Breckin Meyer overdose with her hand gestures and body language. Only Kananga himself, Yaphet Kotto, maintains his dignity. And when Roseanne, Tom Arnold, and Alice Cooper appeared, you can almost see the movie vaguely sinking further. The script is also barely noticeable and almost entirely worthless. Carlos (Ricky Dean Logan) opens a map written by Freddie like Noel Coward, ""You did something stupid."" When prompted for the map, Carlos replies, ""The map is displayed properly."" Who wrote the scenario Oscar Wilde? <br /> <br /> What about the scene where Freddie tortured Carlos? So Freddie can be fatal by threatening to drop the pin when all sounds are enlarged. Strangely, it seems that Carlos yelling in order not to drop his voice has no effect. ""You, Carlos's good news,"" Freddie quietly expects a better line to come out. Also, since the sleep of dreams does not occur naturally, if you fall into an unconscious state, you will not have immediate access to Freddie's world. As part of the story, human computer games are included, but the 3D finale plot logic is not very high in the requirements list. <br /> <br /> Teens for this cast are actually the least noticeable. Dislike groups in the whole series. Tracy (Lessley Dian) is the only person to greet Freddie, ""Shut up the chest"" and kick the scallops. Don't be interested. It's not fun. <br /> <br />","WARNING: A review that includes a mild spoiler <br /> <br /> A few years ago, I was able to watch the first five movies of this franchise and give an overview of the entire Elm St. series. It was planned. But in just two years, I find that I can't remember enough about them to do it. I don't think they were very impressed. From what I remember, some of the sequels-especially Dream Warriors-were not original in the original, but not as bad as they are often made. In general, the predictability of the premise (when people fall asleep, they are killed in dreams) does not lend itself to the tension of the story. But I can't recall many of the first five movies, but they never delve into the depths of Freddie's death. <br /> <br /> A sign of how popular Freddie was at this point was the fact that the film advertised only the demise of the character. Not only the fact that the movie's conclusions are not hidden, but in fact, the movie's purpose is to explain how empty, soulless and ironic this venture was. <br /> <br /> The ridiculous and terrifying interpretation of Robert Engrund, a child's pervert as a charismatic villain, laughs and booms. I always thought Freddie's mockery for teenage victims was less aimed at the character than the teenage audience who could see this tryp. It's like Engrund is yelling, ""I know this is garbage, but you're paying to see it, so who's laughing?"" And I'm convinced that victims of child abuse will be disappointed at seeing such indifferent depictions of their plight. Was Freddie's appearance in films always rudimentary? All he can do here is some ""haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr – har – har – hars"". That's all. If this is the only Elm St. Film you have ever seen, you will never know its character. Even when the pre-mortem character in Flashback Englund plays him as a villain of the transatlantic (ie exaggerated, misplaced, and absolutely crazy) ironic Bouhis pantomime.<br /> <br /> Acting is almost universally poor. See how many times Breckin Meyer overacts with his hand gestures and body language. Only Kananga himself, Yaphetcott, protects his dignity. And when Lausanne, Tom Arnold, and Alice Cooper show up, it's almost visible that the film is almost sunk. The script is also poor and has almost no benefit. Carlos (Ricky Dean Logan) opened the roadmap, and Freddie, like Noel Coward, witnessed on it, ""You are no good."" When asked for a map, Carlos replies, ""The map says we were deceived."" Who wrote the screenplay, Oscar Wilde? <br /> <br /> Or what about a scene where Carlos was tortured by Freddie and his hearing was raised to a painful level? Therefore, Freddy hurts him by threatening to drop the pin. All sounds are magnified, so it's a potentially deadly sound. Oddly enough, the fact that Carlos yells at the top of his voice so as not to drop it seems ineffective. Freddie downplays, hoping for some better lines, ""a good hearing from you, Carlos"". Also, dream sleep doesn't happen instantly, so if you knock it unknowingly, you'll quickly lose access to Freddie's world. Human computer games are included as part of the story, but the 3D finale plot logic is not very high in the list of requirements. <br /> <br /> The teenager who is leading the cast this time is really the most annoying, a group I hate throughout the series. Tracy (Leslie Dean) is the only person to greet Freddie with ""Shack the Fuck Up"" with a scallop kick. And was pop music always a part of the material? Freddy's dead. Don't laugh Not scary. I'm not interested. Uninteresting. <br /> <br />"
"Some comments on IMDb compared Dog Bite Dog to a classic Cat III movie from the 90s, but it is undoubtedly cruel, violent, and very optimistic, but this film by Pou-Soi Cheang is not really funny, noisy, or sensual .

"I watched this movie for a hot guy and even he was sucked! He was the worst man. Well, you also need to give props to that bizarre police officer rapist.

"I can't say much about this movie. I think it thinks of itself (as with the current rating). I rented this about 2 years ago and I regret it.

And I'm not the one who throws the movie into garbage, but I think this is really terrible. It wasn't very fun. The only part I enjoy was a few shots with Christopher Walken. I think this movie ruined both Jack Black and Ben Stiller. What I can think of when watching one of their movies these days is this terrible movie, and it reminds me not to waste money.

"I'm not old enough to remember laughing a few times at Bobcat Goldthwait. But over the years, drug abuse has lost not only cells in the brain, but also a sense of humor. After hearing the opening line, I can't find anything remotely interesting. Goldthwait obviously hates himself so much that he has to fall in order to feel better, even if he is an imaginary person. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Sheikh, you can see how fun Bobcat was 15 years ago... This movie is worse. It wasn't funny by chance. Sad, pathetic and waste of time. I hope Goldthwaits' hand is numb and can't write another script. Hit your tongue so you can't point to other funny scenes.","I'm not old enough to remember laughing at Bobcat Goldthwaite a couple of times. But during all his years of substance abuse, he lost his sense of humor and his brain cells in several places. Also, after listening to the opening line, there's nothing interesting.

"There are many documentaries I have seen, and the law seems to be on the other side of the fence. The thin blue line and paradise come to mind first. However, this is the first movie that gets angry after I watch it. It seems obvious to me in the evidence presented in this film that what happened at Waco was the most unprofessional, crude mess in the FBI and AFI parts and the worst murder. Like most people, when Waco's siege broke out, David Koresh thought he was a completely evil madness leading violent worship. After seeing this, it is likely that Koresh is a slightly disproportionate and confusing person who accidentally caught the attention of the US government through his eccentric behavior. Of course, there were many weapons at the David Davidian branch. But none were illegal. Watching video footage of people inside the compound was absolutely heartbreaking. It all seems very good and harmless. And indifferent testimony to people in charge of government forces at the Waco site, Janet Leno's unquestionable testimony, and partisan defense of the attack on Waco, a lawyer led by a handful of Democrats. The most prominent in my opinion was the NY Representative and the current Senator of NY Charles Schumer. I voted for a man when I lived in New York State. I am a Democrat. After seeing his actions on this committee, I hope we can vote in time for D'Amato instead! It is a must-see movie for anyone who is remotely interested in the government.

"I decided to comment immediately after watching the movie ""Hoot"". The truth is that nature is supposed to protect us because we are the dominant species of this planet. Some people think that with money, they can do what they want. Probably similar to the future. This movie is not about children.

When I was twelve years old, I saw some training, I knew I was protected by the law, and I was not afraid of the law, but I was afraid of harm.

"When I first saw this movie about 6 months ago, I thought it was interesting, but nothing more. But it was attached to me.

"Focus is another great film starring William H. Macy. I first found Macy in Fargo and watched a few of his movies, but he hasn't cheated on me yet. Macy is a typical person of ""a good person with something to hide"". At Focus, he plays the role of a loyal, hard-working stiff Lawrence Newman with a disabled mother at home. The scene reached the peak of McCarthyism after World War II. Newman is basically the head of human resources for a semi-focused company. After accidentally hiring a Jewish woman, he was asked to buy glasses to improve his vision. The great Laura Dern of his wife Gertrude Heart played. As the movie is released, Newman will begin to see a world completely different from becoming a Jew and an animal. <br /> <br /> The film is confusing in a way that shows that racism is fairly ordinary. I think the cold mind is still there in some areas.","Focus is another great movie starring William H. Macy. I first found Macy in Fargo, and watched some of his movies, and he hasn't cheated me yet. Macy is a typical ""nice guy with something to hide"". In focus, he plays the role of loyal and hardworking Lawrence Newman, who has a disabled mother at home. The scene is set at the height of McCarthyism after World War II. Newman is responsible for the Human Resources department of a company that is basically anti-Semitic. He has been asked to purchase eyeglasses to improve his sight lost after he accidentally hired a Jewish woman. <br /> <br /> Incredibly, the simple act of buying glasses has a huge impact on his life Gertrude Hurt and his wife (played by the great Laura Dern). When the film is unveiled, Newman begins to see a whole different world, where being a Jew is an animal. The terrifying idea is that in some places it is probably still there."
"In ""Brave New Girl"", Holly comes from a small town in Texas and sings ""The Yellow Rose of Texas"" at a regional convention to enter Philadelphia's famous art college. There, the film grows into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty. I liked this movie. It was full of great songs, acting and characters, so it moved at a very good speed. The acting was of course great. Virginia Madson and Lindsay Haun, as well as Nick Ross, were great, and it was a great help to the directors and everyone else involved in this work.

"Despite a completely misleading advertising campaign, the film turned out to be a completely incredible ending to the House House movie of annoying tremors, a clue to consider seeing this turkey # 1:. Sam Raimi has not directed movie ads. Evoke his participation, but in fact he is one of the four producers. It's too bad to allow talented people like Raimi to use his name along with his bad movies. I don't think he would have ordered this way. This work was left to Fang Brothers. <br /> <br /> The screenplay of this film seems to be united with numerous other ""horror"" films. ""The Messengers."" What we get is a scene ripped from ""Pulse"", a couple that can come from one or two of ""The Birds"", ""The Others"". Almost every scene, almost every line conversation has been released in several other movies. Everything will make a predictable movie and you'll be able to figure it out long before almost everyone comes to the ""amazing ending"". <br /> <br /> The right here is that the campaign focused on the idea that advertising is only for children to see ghosts and has nothing to do with this movie. In fact, everyone can see ghosts. Teenage daughter and mother characters definitely saw them at the beginning of the movie. Marketers would have created this campaign because the film needed a unique angle to have a box office appeal. Now you know, don't be fooled! Perhaps the shortest thing in this film was something similar to chemistry between actors. It simply doesn't exist. All interactions were awkwardly twisted. With a hackneyed story and a silly plot (who murdered the family around the small town where the murder occurred? Anyway? Did anyone ever intend to arrest him?), it all merges. “Boo!” howling with loud sounds, dazzling flashes, and creaks on the walls. What we get to make money this time is another ill-made movie about the soul trying to warn people at home. If there is a message from ""Messenger"", ""Don't waste time in this movie.""","Despite a completely misleading advertising campaign, this flick turned out to be a frustrating, jerky, semi-standard haunted house flick with a completely incredible ending. Clues #1 for All Those Considering Watching This Turkey # Sam Raimi Did Not Direct. The film commercials inspire his involvement, but in reality he is one of four producers. It's a pity that a talented person like Raimi allowed his name to be used in combination with such poor films. I don't think he has directed anything like this. The job was left to Pan Bros. <br /> <br /> The screenplay for this movie seems to have come from many other ""horror"" movies. Therefore, ""Messenger"" has no original content at all. ""You get here a scene pulled straight from ""Pulse"", a couple from ""The Birds"", 1-2 pieces from ""The Others"", etc. Almost every scene, almost every line interaction, is lifted from many other films. The whole is a very predictable movie, so almost anyone can understand “surprise ending” long before that. <br /> <br /> Surely a campaign centered around the idea that advertising can only see ghosts in children has nothing to do with this movie. In fact, everyone can see ghosts. Characters of teenage daughters and mothers certainly see them even early in the movie. I think marketers came up with this campaign because it needed a unique angle to get the box office appealing. Okay, don't be fooled! Perhaps what this film lacks above all resembles chemistry between actors. It simply isn't there. All interactions awkwardly encounter as columns. Coupled with Hackney's story and the holes in the ridiculous conspiracy (what is the man still murdering the whole family around the murdered small town doing? A crappy shot for anyone over the age of 10 Incredibly satisfying ghost flicks: loud noises, visual flashes, popping out of the closet and ""boo!"" We're rewarded this time for people away from home. Another poor movie about the spirits to warn: ""Don't waste your time on this movie"" if the message ""The Messengers"" conveys."
"This movie sucks the ass. Some of the heat waves in European countries, complete garbage. There is nothing in this movie. It's probably just 30 seconds of sex. There are very annoying chicks who ride on rides with people and really get mad. This movie is a complete rash and should not be watched in person. I am sorry that it is very boring. I can't rate it as 0, but I can't. You shouldn't see this in their right minds. You will regret what I did. How could they think of this bad thing? Even the mystery man was better. Mystery man.

"I was expecting a guardian, but when I entered the theater, I didn't feel the atmosphere at that particular time. It is similar to Olive Garden. I like it, but I need to have the right mindset to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I don't know exactly what's weakening my mind. The trailer looked good, but the water theme was giving me a bad backfire at the last Kevin Costner movie -Waterworld, which covers the subject. Also, despite the promise Ashton Kutcher showed in The Butterfly Effect, he was still not fully sold to him. Something about the guy annoys me Perhaps it's related to his Simian function. <br /> <br /> It took me about 2 minutes for my fears to calm down and my hesitation to go away. The film immediately threw us into the middle of a tense rescue mission, and I held it tighter than Kenny Rogers' orange face lift. When Cooker first appeared, my concerns were short, because his worries were too cool and too much effort to be rebellious. Tough toothpick sunglasses in your mouth and sunglasses that boast a smirk that prides you on George Clooney? Yes, we get it. I was ready to hate him. <br /> <br /> Then he exerted a fairly strong performance and forced the ja to soften. <br /> <br /> Morning, monkey man! The Guardian is a daring movie that can be enjoyed by most of the audience by efficiently mixing tension, exciting rescue scenes, drama, humor and solid acting. You can take a quiz on clichés, predictability, and rare moments of overcooked pleasure, but it's not far from entertainment value. While training young people, training sessions can be the most exciting part of the movie. Coast Guard Rescue Swimmers talk on the big screen. I'm a hero who has never portrayed so I see and feel internally how hard it is to see what they're going through and what's inside -.. thanks group <br /> <br /> Is there anything I need to be a rescue swimmer? Performing dangerous missions in cold, dark, and rough water will help you fight disorientation, fatigue, hypothermia, and lack of oxygen. For their survival. And if everything is not bad enough, sometimes you can't save everyone, so you have to decide who will die and who will die. <br /> <br /> Who wants all those responsibilities? I'm not! I had no idea what these people actually looked like, and who would have thought to have the Ashton Kutcher/Kevin Costner movie to thank for the education? <br /> <br /> Not only does the Guardian do a great job of paying homage to this rare heroic race, it's also great to entertain lucky customers. <br /> <br /> Huge <br /> <br /> Movie spectators who want to see from the inside as they embark on a bold rescue mission in the middle of the ocean will want to give The Guardian a chance. I've seen it for free, but you might have felt it was worth the money if you paid.","I was looking forward to The Guardian, but when I stepped into the theater, I didn't feel good at that particular time.

The trailer looked good, but the water theme was giving a bad flashback to the last Kevin Costner movie-Waterworld that covered the subject. Moreover, despite the promise Ashton Kutcher made in The Butterfly Effect, I haven't sold him completely yet. Something about the man bothers me. Probably related to the characteristics of his monkey. <br /> <br /> It took me about 2 minutes for the fear to subside and the hesitation to disappear. The film immediately threw us into the midst of a tense rescue mission, and I was more gripped than Kenny Rogers's orange facelift. My concern was temporarily angry at Kutcher's first appearance due to the fact that too much effort was made to portray him as ridiculously cool and rebellious. Sunglasses, a tough toothpick in his mouth, and a sporty sport that would make George Clooney proud? Yeah, I understand. I was completely ready to hate him. <br /> <br /> But then he had to do a pretty powerful act to make me soften the jab. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Ape! Efficiently combining tense and exciting rescue scenes, drama, humor, and solid acting, Guardian will enjoy a large audience. You can misunderstand its clichés, predictability, and the rare moments of overburning happiness, but without losing the value of entertainment. Training a young man, on the contrary, a training session may be the most interesting aspect of the film. The Coast Guard Rescue Swimmer is a hero whose story has never been depicted on the big screen. So we'll look inside from how they experience it and how difficult it is to be a very helpful way of presenting it to viewers. -Thanks group. <br /> <br /> Is there anything you need to be a rescue swimmer? Think about-you can go on a dangerous mission in cold, dark, rough waters, and you're crazy while trying to help stuck panicked people who are dependent on you You have to fight disability, fatigue, hypothermia, lack of oxygen for their survival. And if all goes well, then no one can save, and you have to make a tough decision about who will live and who will die. <br /> <br /> What about someone who wants all that responsibility? not me! I didn't know what it really was for these guys, and who thought to have the Ashton Kutcher/Kevin Costner movie to thank the education? <br /> <br /> The Guardian not only pays homage to this rare kind of hero, but fortunately can entertain paying customers. <br /> <br /> THE GIST <br /> <br /> The movie enthusiast who wants to see what it's like to embark on a bold rescue mission in the middle of the sea is The Guardian May want to give you a chance.

"When I went to see Seven Pounds, I wasn't sure what to think, because the preview is open a lot to figure out what the movie really is. So in the first 20 minutes you are completely lost on the plot and have no idea what is going on. And I think the team that claims to be Ben is just a big asshole. It all ends when the movie's last minute ""Twiss"" is released. Basically Tim (meaning Smith Smith) was struggling with a big accident that killed seven people. Through this, he decides to dedicate his life to a range of seven new people who need his help. <br /> <br /> The acting of this film is amazing. He seems to be impressed. Rosario Dawson, for me, this is one of her better films, except the Eagle Eye I think. She went through some bad things, but conveys it through this film. Other actors, such as woody Harrelson, play very small roles and not big enough to identify a character. The cast of the movie was still good, but. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely not what I was expecting, and certainly the speed I wanted was much slower. But the movie was still pretty good.

"I loved watching Brother's Shadow at the Tribeca Film Festival! Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are great as fathers and sons. The film follows Scott Cohen from parole in Alaska and returns to his family in Brooklyn. He appears there because his brother is dead, and begins a journey to slowly fix the fussing relationship with his brother's wife and children and a father who has not forgiven him with the black sheep of his family. This story digs deep into the hearts and minds of this family, allowing them to understand their complexities more deeply. In addition, the woodworking business and Brooklyn background image create a rich and open family portrait atmosphere.","I saw Brothers Shadow at the Tribeca Film Festival and loved it.Jud Hirsch and Scott Cohen are great fathers and sons.The film follows Scott Cohen back from his Alaskan parole to his family in Brooklyn.His brother died so he appears there and embarks on a journey to slowly restore the estranged relationship between his wife and child, and his father who never allowed him to be the black sheep of his family.The story takes us deep into the heart and depth of this family and allows you to better understand the intricacies of their lives.The woodworking image and Brooklyn background set the tone for this rich and clear family portrait."
"""Mararía"" was really disappointed. I can't think of it as a bad movie, but development seemed too rushing and too hard to believe. Dr. Fermín demonstrates unprecedented bizarre behavior with a passion that is not really understandable where he was born. How many times has he spoke with Mararía? Maybe once? Also, Mararía did not seem to be a real character. Instead, it's similar to the movie stereotype that you need to be in a movie (or did you need another title?). Some of the best acting comes from a role that is not important to the story, the role of Marcial, an unintelligent but humble drunk man. Of course, the scenery, the cultural atmosphere of the Canary Islands, and other ""wow"" moments were interesting, but the film fell short of a documentary (if this was the real intention), and most importantly, a solid drama","""Malaria"" was really disappointing.

"Serum is about a crazy doctor looking for a serum that needs to treat all diseases through the power of the mind. Instead, it creates a kind of monster that needs to eat human flesh and brain. Crazy doctor makes zombies from the body and has some problems. There are very long leads to every action, as many scenes emerge and get used to the character. The crazy doctor's nephew has a car accident, and the crazy doctor tries to use the new serum for the boy. The results are not good. This is a class C film that works fine, but which dictates some problems and has continuity errors. There aren't many zombies in this, and the effect is good, but nothing special.

"It's a unique film that gives you the only chance to see a young Noel coward with his ironic glory.

"어떤 사람들은 인생을 떠돌아 다니며 눈을 쓰지 않고 한 사람에서 다른 사람으로 이동합니다. 다른 사람들은 원인, 다른 사람 또는 원칙에 사로 잡히고 단호하게 남아 있으며 그것이 무엇이든간에 헌신적이며, 비 유적으로 또는 문자 적으로 그들은 그들의 말을하고 그것을지지합니다. 그러나이 영화의 등장 인물 중 하나가 말하듯이, 우리는 '다른 점토로 만들어졌다'는 점이 다르다. 그러나 어떤 사람들은 평범한 미치광이 일 수도 있습니다. 아마도 그것은 당신이 대중들 사이에서 살아야하는 방식 일 것입니다. 누가 알아? 일 (생명)을 작동시키는 데 무엇이 필요한지 누가 알 수 있습니까? 작가 / 감독 인 리사 크루거 (Lisa Krueger)는 젊은 여성으로 Heather Graham이 주연 한 'Committed (커밋 됨)'에서 커밋 된 것과 커밋 된 방식, 그리고 커밋 된 것 사이의 얇은 선을 조사하기 위해 간단한 접근법을 사용하여 촬영합니다. 단호하고 헌신적이며 강박 적이며 어쩌면 약간 미쳤습니다. 그녀의 이름은 Joline이고 이것은 그녀의 이야기입니다. <br /> <br /> 분명히 Joline은 헌신적 인 사람이었습니다. 직장, 관계, 일반적으로 삶에서. 그녀는 무슨 일이 있어도 그 말을 고집하는 말의 여자입니다. 그리고 그녀가 칼 (루크 윌슨)과 결혼 할 때, 그것은 영원합니다. 유일한 문제는 누군가 칼에게 말을 잊어 버리고 결혼에 597 일이 지났다는 것입니다. 스스로를 '찾아서'알아 내야합니다. 졸린이 돌아 오지 않는다는 것을 깨달았을 때, 그녀는 그 또는 결혼을 포기하지 않습니다. 아마 그녀가 만든 '점토'때문일 수도 있습니다. 어쨌든, 그녀는 뉴욕시에서 집을 떠나 텍사스 엘파소에서 모든 곳에서 그를 찾아 나섰습니다. 그러나 그녀가 자신의 위치를 ​​알면 거리를 유지하고 '공간'을 제공하며 자신이 그곳에 있다는 사실조차 알리지 않습니다. 그녀는 칼을 '영적 혼수 상태'로 생각하고, 자신의 감각에 도달 할 때까지 '영적 경계'를 유지하는 것이 그녀의 임무입니다. 그리고 그녀가보고 기다리는 동안, 그녀는 지역 식당 중 한 곳에서 웨이트리스 인 카르멘 (Patricia Velazquez)이라는 젊은 여성을 만났을 때 그녀의 인생은 둔할뿐입니다. 카르멘의`Grampy '(알폰소 아라우)는 신비한 사람이다. 칼에 관한 문제가있는 트럭 운전사 인 T-Bo (Mark Ruffalo); 피 나타를 만들고 그녀를 좋아하는 예술가 인 Neil (Goran Visnjic). 졸린에게는 발견의 여정으로, 그녀는 칼에 대해 많은 것을 배우지 만 자신에 대해 더 많이 배웁니다. <br /> <br /> 유머 감각, 로맨스 감각, 인간 본성에 대한 통찰력이 있습니다. 이 기발한 영화는 음모보다 성격과 성격에 관한 것입니다. 그리고 Krueger는 모든 것을 매우 잘 표현하여 흥미롭고 재미있는 영화를 제공합니다. 그녀의 성격은 인간의 상태를 구성하는 모든 요구, 요구 및 불완전 성을 가진 매우 실제적인 사람들입니다. 그녀는 그녀의 이야기를 통해 풍부하고 절충적인 무리. Krueger가 Joline의 생각과 동기에 자부심을 느끼면서 Joline의 관점에서 볼 수 있습니다. 이는 이벤트가 전개 될 때 결정적인 관점을 제시합니다. 그것은 그녀가 분위기와 분위기를 흡수 할 수있는 고의적 인 페이스와 함께 매우 효과적인 스토리 텔링을 만듭니다. 이 주제에는 근본적인 진지함이 있지만 Krueger는 겁이 많거나 너무 깊은 것을 피하고 Joline이 만나는 사람들과 상황에서 진화하는 자연스러운 유머에 집중합니다. 그리고 결과는 우리가 삶이라고 부르는 것을 잘 짜여지고, 영향을주고, 낙관적 인 모습으로 보여줍니다. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham은 영화의 첫 번째 프레임에서 Joline을 자신 만의 캐릭터로 만들기 위해이 역할을 맡습니다. 창조. 그녀는 자신을 그 부분에 몰입시키고 설득력 있고 믿을만한 성능을 제공하여 개인의 단순한 묘사와 실제의 묘사 사이의 모든 차이를 만드는 작은 개인적인 특성과 뉘앙스를 추가합니다. 그리고이 영화가 작동하기 위해서는 Joline이 실행 가능하고 믿을 수 있어야했으며 Graham은 모든면에서 성공했습니다. 그녀의 스크린 존재는 결코 더 매혹적인 적이 없으며 그녀의 역동적 인 성격 또는 심지어 그녀가 눈을 사용하는 방식으로도 당신을 완전히 끌기에 충분합니다. 그것은 그녀가 만드는 캐릭터의 모든 부분입니다. Joline에게 그녀의 안과 밖에서 온 전체 얼굴에서 나온 호소가 있습니다. 그녀는 호의적이고 호의적 인 사람이며, 그녀가 가장 깊은 생각을 공유했기 때문에 그녀는 누구인지 알고 있습니다. 캐릭터가 쓰여진 방식부터 그레이엄이 그녀를 활기차게 삶에 가져 오는 방식에 이르기까지 모든면에서 훌륭한 일입니다. <br /> <br /> 카르멘으로서 패트리샤 벨라 스케 즈도 매우 매력적입니다. 그녀의 공연은 매우 자연스럽고 간단하며 본능을 사용하여 효과적으로 캐릭터를 만듭니다. 그녀는 카리스마있는 존재를 가지고 있지만 화려한 것은 아니며, 그녀에게 매력적인 지구 적 측면을 제공합니다. 그녀는 상쾌하고 개방적입니다. 카르멘은 아무것도지지하지 않는 것이 아니라 모든면에서 완전히 정직하며 또한 그녀의 호소의 일부라는 인상을받습니다. Joline과 마찬가지로이 캐릭터는 잘 쓰여졌으며 Velazquez는 그녀를 설득력있게 생생하게 만듭니다. <br /> <br /> 전반적 으로이 영화의 심장과 영혼을 포함하여 많은 주목할만한 공연이 있습니다. Luke Wilson, Casey Affleck (Joline의 형제 인 Jay), Goran Visnjic, Alfonso Arau, 특히 Mark Ruffalo는 실제 스크린 시간이 거의 없어 기억에 남는 캐릭터를 만들 수 있습니다. <br /> <br / > 지원 캐스트에는 Kim Dickens (Jenny), Clea Du Vall (Mimi), Summer Phoenix (Meg), Art Alexakis (New York Car Thief), Dylan Baker (Carl 's Editor) 및 Mary Kay Place (Psychiatrist)가 포함됩니다. 우리가 누구인지, 우리가 어디로 가고 있는지, 그리고 실제로 필요한 것을 반영하여 '큰 그림'을 고려하기 위해 되돌아가는 가치에 대해 이야기하는 영화 '약속'은 즐거운 경험입니다. 확실히 가치가있는 타는 것. 8/10.",一部の人々は、目を奪うことなく、あるものまたはある人から次の人に移動して、人生を漂います。他の人は、大義、別の人、または原則にとらわれ、固執し、それが何であるかに専念します。しかし、この映画の登場人物の1人が表現しているように、「メイドオブクレイ」は私たち全員が異なっています。それが人生をとても面白くしているものです。とはいえ、単純に気が狂っている人もいます-そして、それが大衆の中で生きるために必要な方法なのかもしれません。知るか？物事-人生-を機能させるために必要なことを誰が知っていますか？ライター/ディレクターのリサ・クルーガーは、軽いアプローチを使用してそれを狙い撃ちし、コミットされていることと「コミットされる」方法との間の細い線と、ヘザーグラハムが若い女性として主演している「コミットされている」という強迫観念を調べます厳格で、献身的で、強迫観念で、たぶん少しクレイジーでもあります。彼女の名前はジョリーヌで、これは彼女の物語です。<br /> <br />確かに、ジョリーヌは常に献身的な人でした。仕事、人間関係、生活全般において。彼女は何があってもそれを貫く彼女の言葉の女性です。そして彼女がカール（ルーク・ウィルソン）と結婚するとき、それは永遠です。唯一の問題は、誰かがカールに話すのを忘れていたことです。そして結婚597日目で、彼は去っています。自分を「見つけて」、それをすべて理解するために。ジョリーヌが彼が戻ってこないことに気付いたとき、彼女は彼または彼らの結婚をあきらめることを拒否します。多分それは彼女が作ったその「粘土」のせいでしょう。とにかく、彼女はニューヨーク市に家を出て、彼を見つけるために出発します-彼女はそれを-テキサス州エルパソであらゆる場所で見つけます。しかし、彼女が彼がどこにいるかを知ると、彼女は距離を保ち、彼に「スペース」を与え、彼女がそこにいることを彼に知らせることさえしません。彼女はカールを「精神的な昏睡状態」にあると考えており、彼が彼の感覚に達するまで彼に「精神的な警戒」を続けることが彼女の仕事です。そして彼女が見つめている間、彼女の人生は退屈なものであり、地元の飲食店の1つでウェイトレスであるカルメン（パトリシアベラスケス）という若い女性に出会いました。カルメンの「グランピー」（Alfonso Arau）。神秘的なものです。 T-Bo（Mark Ruffalo）、カールに関して問題があるトラック運転手。そして、ニール（ゴランヴィスニッチ）はピニャータを作り、彼女に夢中になるアーティストです。ジョリーヌにとって、それは発見の旅であり、その間に彼女はカールについて多くを学びますが、彼女自身についてはさらにもっと学びます。<br /> <br />ユーモアのタッチ、ロマンスのタッチ、そして人間の本性へのいくつかの洞察があります。この奇抜な映画は、プロットよりも特徴と性格についてです。そしてクルーガーはそれをすべて非常にうまく提示し、魅力的で面白い映画を提供します。彼女の性格は非常に現実的な人々であり、人間の状態を構成するすべての欲求、必要性、不完全さを備えています。彼女が物語を語る豊かで折衷的な束。クルーガーは私たちをジョリーンの考え、したがって彼女のモチベーションに気を遣わせるので、ジョリーンの視点からそれを見ることができます。それは、彼女が設定する意図的なペースと一緒に、彼女が作成する雰囲気と雰囲気を吸収することを可能にし、ストーリーテリングの非常に効果的な作品になります。この主題には根本的な重大性がありますが、クルーガーは強引な、または深すぎるものは避け、代わりにジョリーヌが遭遇する人々や状況から生まれる自然なユーモアに集中します。そして、その結果、私たちが人生と呼んでいるものによく織り込まれ、影響を与え、明るい雰囲気になります。<br /> <br />ヘザーグラハムは、映画の最初のフレームからこの役割を担い、ジョリーヌを彼女自身のキャラクターにしました作成。彼女はその部分に没頭し、説得力があり、信じられるパフォーマンスを提供し、個人の単なる描写である描写と現実の描写の間のすべての違いを生む小さな個人的な特徴とニュアンスを追加します。そして、この映画が機能するためには、ジョリーヌが生きていて信じられることが不可欠でした-そして、グラハムはあらゆる面で成功しています。彼女の画面の存在はこれまで以上に魅力的であり、彼女の鮮やかな性格、または彼女が彼女の目を使う方法でさえ、あなたを完全に引き込むのに十分です。それはすべて彼女が作成するキャラクターの一部です。ジョリーヌには、彼女の内側と外側にいる彼女の顔全体から滲み出る魅力があります。彼女は好感の持てる快い人であり、あなたは彼女の最も内側の考えを共有したので、あなたは彼女が誰であるかを知っています。グラハムが彼女を生き生きと生き生きとさせる方法に至るまで、それはずっと良い仕事です。<br /> <br />カルメンとして、パトリシアベラスケスも完全に魅力的です。彼女のパフォーマンスは非常に自然でわかりやすく、本能を使用して効果的にキャラクターを作成しています。彼女はカリスマ的な存在感を持っていますが、派手ではなく、魅力的で現実的な面を彼女に与えます。彼女はさわやかにオープンで前向きです。カルメンは何かを抑えるのではなく、すべての面で正直であるという印象を受けます。それも彼女の魅力の1つです。そして、ジョリーンと同様に、このキャラクターはよく書かれており、ベラスケスは彼女を説得力のある形で生き生きとさせます。<br /> <br />全体的に、この映画の心と魂である注目すべきパフォーマンスがいくつかあります。ルークウィルソン、ケーシーアフレック（ジョリーの兄弟、ジェイとして）、ゴランヴィスニッチ、アルフォンソアラウ、特にマークルファロはT-Boとして、実際のスクリーン時間はほとんどなく、記憶に残るキャラクターを作成しています。<br /> <br / >サポートキャストには、キムディケンズ（ジェニー）、クレアデュヴァル（ミミ）、サマーフェニックス（メグ）、アートアレクサキス（ニューヨークカーシーフ）、ディランベイカー（カールの編集者）、メアリーケイプレイス（精神科医）が含まれます。私たちが誰であるか、私たちがどこに行くか、そして私たちが本当に必要としているものを反映して、全体像を考えるために後退することの価値について何かを語っている映画。間違いなく乗る価値のある乗り物。 8/10。

"I like this book greatly, and I was looking forward to it a lot. But when it came out, I remember thinking it was one of the biggest money and time I spent in the cinema. <br /> <br /> In principle, acting, sets and music were great, and that's the main reason I rated this rating on a 4-point scale. There is no way she deliberately lied to Minchin to stop punishing other women. In this book, she describes lying as ""not evil, but vulgar."" <br /> <br /> Too many Disneyfied endings for me. Sarah's father returned from the dead and all were able to run into the Indian sunset. There is a happy ending in this book, and critics can say that it's equally impossible, but I don't think it's ""Oh, Lee Lee."" <br /> <br /> The only truths about this book are: <br /> <br /> 1. Sara's father became a soldier. 2. The boundary between Sara and her father (""Are you learning me with your heart?"" / ""No. You know you with your heart. You are in my heart."") 3. Sara's and Becky's friendship Her'Recruitment' Lottie (though this last one wasn't developed much more than it was developed), that part performed well. 5. The basic core of a rich girl who suddenly falls into poverty exists, but that's all. <br /> <br /> People can say that this adaptation is more suitable for a younger audience. Perhaps. What I can say is that I have two cousins, 7 and 12 years old, who were avid fans of this movie until I read this book. <br /> <br /> Everything you want is a'good feeling' family movie, then this offers. If you're looking for a movie that actually tells the story of a little princess (if you've actually read a book), don't waste time with it. It is a shame. It would have been fantastic if they had at least obsessed with the basic story with this runcast. <br /> <br />'Read the book' Read the book'Read the book' a little too? Maybe yo, but if someone tries to apply a movie like a book, especially a classic, they're at least equal.","As a big fan of this book, I was looking forward to it. But I remember when it was announced I thought it was one of the biggest wastes of money and time ever spent in the movie. <br /> <br /> In principle, acting, sets and music were excellent, and that's the main reason I rate this as 4. <br /> <br /> In this version, Sarah is a little self-sacrificing to my taste. She wouldn't stop deliberately lying to Minchin and punishing the other girls. In the book, she emphasizes explaining the lie as ""not just evil but vulgar."" <br /> <br /> Also, Disney Fide has too many endings. Sarah's father is resurrected from death and they all run to the sunset in India. The book ends with happiness (and unlikely with critics), but don't think ""Oh, Pleise."" <br /> <br /> Only the following points apply to this book: <br /> <br /> 1. Sarah's father is a soldier 2. The line between Sarah and her father (""Are you memorizing me?""/""No, I am memorizing you. You are my heart. 3.) Sarah's friendship with Becky, and her ""recruitment"" Lotti (although this last one wasn't as developed as it was) 4. Various luxury items Change the room by adding. That part was done brilliantly. 5. There is a basic core-a wealthy girl who suddenly falls into poverty-but that's it. <br /> <br /> People may say this adaptation is more suitable for a younger audience. maybe. What I can say is that I have two cousins ​​(7 and 12 respectively) who were big fans of the film until they read the book. <br /> <br /> All you need is a ""if you feel good"" family-friendly movie. If you're looking for a movie that really tells the story of the little princess (actually, if you've read a book), don't waste your time on this movie. That's a shame; it's great for a cast like this, at least if you stick to the basic story. <br /> <br /> Am I thinking of this as ""I read a book"" and ""I read a book""? too little? maybe. But if someone wants to incorporate books, especially such classics, into movies, they should have done at least the same thing. If possible, twice or more."

He cites baseball separated from his 30s and 40s, but he doesn't realize that the United States was separated at the time! Burns fell in love with former Negrig player Buck O'Neil, and the old O'Neil went through all the poetic waxing of his performances. Nonsense... <br /> <br /> Burns would have helped edit his work with adults. ""Baseball"" leads to a slimy, rough, civil rights propaganda disguised as Americana.

""나는 어떻게 행동해야할지 몰랐다"" 그들에게 대응할 수있는 약물. 그는 ""감독이 원했던 일을하기 위해 높이 높아야했다""고 말했다. 그래서 배우로서의 얕은 정체성은 마약을 통해 정체성에서 벗어날 수 있습니다. <br /> <br /> Hongshen의 약물 분리와 그의 거짓된 삶은 매우 점진적이고 간헐적이며 완전히 독창적입니다. 고독, 공간, 명상적 사고, 언어 거부, 요법 대체. 초록이 나왔습니다. 그리고 그의 변화의 상당 부분은 야외에서 이루어집니다. 이상적인 장소가 아니라 주로 베이징의 고속도로, 다리, 고층 빌딩 아래 녹색 패치가 있습니다. 육체는 거의 낭만적이지만 그렇지 않습니다. 자전거는 리탄 파크 (Ritan Park), 긴 자연 산책, 흠뻑 햇볕에 쬐고 비, 잔디 피크닉, 하늘 패턴과 그의 근육을 흡수하는 연을 매우 구체적으로 타게됩니다. 그는 도착하기 위해 표류하면서 더욱 사실적이고 사실적인 정체성에 대한 신호를 얻습니다. 그는이시기에 대해 회고하며 ""개방하기 시작했다""고 말했다. 그리고 접촉은 현재 상황에서 일종의 댄서의 위치 (서투른, 우아하고 유머, 말하기)를 투영하는 그의 몸이 엉뚱한 몸에서 시작되는 것 같습니다. 마음이나 정신이 부족하면 다리가 밤새도록 강요 할 수 있습니다. <br /> <br /> 그의 복귀의 중심은 정해진 역할을 거부하는 것이다. 연기에 종지부를 찍고 새로운 정체성에 대한 결심을하기 위해 그는 비디오와 TV를 부수고 ""John Lennon Forever""포스터에 피를 흘릴 때까지 머리를 부딪쳤다. 그는 자신의 상징적 인 반 설립 예술가를 실망 시켰습니다. 그러나 그는 그가 아는 ​​유일한 유능한 가이드입니다. 그는 자신을 요한의 아들 (요코 오노)로 상상하고, ""어둠의 시간""과 ""곤란의 시간""에서 ""어머니 마리아""를 중보자로 채택합니다. (공원에서 쇠약하고, 떨리는 고통-환각과 스키 츠 오드 시련)“음악은 연기보다 훨씬 더 현실적”이라고 그는 말한다. 레논의 영향은 ""새로운 길을 보여줘""라고 말합니다. 정신 연구소에서 생명을 구하는 사과 (저항성, 영양분)는 Hongshen이 새 단장을 마친 방에서 영웅의 포스터를 다시 걸 필요가있는 것처럼 Lennon의 존재를 반영합니다. 아버지의 영향은 접지입니다. 아버지와 아들은 배우이자 사용자 (마약 및 음료)이지만 Fegsen과 아들의 차이점은 그의 변화를 덮어 씁니다. 아버지는 자신이 더 안전하기 때문에 : 그는 자신이 농민의 한 농민, 시골 연극 감독 인 중국인임을 받아들입니다. 그리고 그는 습관과 감정을 통제합니다. 홍선이 그를 울리는 보드처럼, 때로는 분노와 분노, 때로는 유머 (청바지, 비틀즈)와 수동성을 가진 사람으로 대우하는 것은이 인식 할 수있는 정체성입니다. 그는 아버지와의 가장 열렬하고 폭력적인 교환에서 그가 거짓말 쟁이와 가짜라고 비난하면서 그의 아버지보다 자신을 더 많이 폭로합니다. ""내가 한 모든 행동은 헛소리 였어. "" 그리고 홍센의 """"당신은 나의 아버지가 아니에요. ""그는""농민이 왜 당신의 아버지가 될 수 없습니까? ""라고 부드럽게 대답합니다. <br /> <br />이 두 교사들과 재활 기관의 어머니, 자매, 친구, 수감자들의 도움을 많이 받으면 그는 (전체가 아닌) 자기 자신과 실질적인 관계를 맺습니다. 장기적인 약물 효과가 줄어들면서 그의 오래된 정체성도 사라집니다. 빚은 자존심, 신뢰 불신을 대체합니다. 무결성은 그의 검은 구름을 추방합니다. 그의 모든 가장자리가 부드러워집니다. ""당신은 단지 인간 일뿐입니다.""그는 약을 거부하기 위해 발생한 끈에서 풀려 난 후 끝없이 반복됩니다. 집으로 돌아와 라드 농민 비누는 이제 괜찮습니다. 그리고 그의 한때 ""희귀하고 진실한 우정""은 그의 음악가 친구와 함께 맹렬한 연속 담장 장면으로 다시 드러나 듯이 다시 시작됩니다. Hongshen은이 영화에 대해 다음과 같이 말합니다. 그리고 저는 예술과 삶에 얽매이는 새로운 배우가 될 수도 있습니다. 레논과 마찬가지로 그는 정체성을 잃지 않고 성공했습니다.",「辞退」は、薬物の使用中止と同じくらい、事前に定められたアイデンティティを終了することと同じくらいかもしれません。北京に来る田舎の男として、階級と成功は彼のルーツから分離し、彼の農民の両親の演技の成功をはるかに超える魅力としてこの若いアーティストの顔を打ったに違いありません。しかし、問題が発生するのは、新しい男性があまりにも新しい場合、家族、歴史、自然、個人のアイデンティティーからの大きな逸脱を要求する場合です。その後の分裂、想像と現実の混同、そして普通と英雄の不協和は、​​一方では腸検査のようなものであり、他方では自己からの完全な脱出です。洪神は後者に陥り、自己への彼の長くて孤独な道は厳しいかもしれません。<br /> <br />しかし、非常に説得力のある特異性、誠実さ、そして官能的な監督の張陽と彼の俳優がこの旅にもたらすもの。決まり文句、ステレオタイプ、厳格なジェンダーの役割、必須のセックス、ロマンス、暴力シーン、必須のストリートランゲージ、起動するために、キャラクターの行動や気まぐれを流すための想定されるお金はありません。 <br /> <br /> Hongshen Jiaは20代半ばです。彼は才能のある俳優で、印象的で、無駄で、理想主義的で、おそらく感情的に飢えています。彼のイネーブラーのための完璧なレシピ。すぐに彼は「クールな」俳優になり、若者に憧れます。 「彼は90年代の初めに熱くなりました。」 「彼は常に最もファッショナブルでなければなりませんでした。」彼は両極端を必要とし、ヘビーメタルに乗り、イヤリングとスカーフを採用しています。彼の演技は芸術、友達、そして役割を意味しますが、個人的な挑戦や意見を提供するようなものではありません。そして、成功の即時性に鈍化した彼の自己批判は、不合理な自己疑念、自己嫌悪への扉を開きます-「私は行動する方法がわかりませんでした」「私は偽りのように感じました」-そしてすぐにそれらに対抗するために利用可能な薬。彼は、「監督が望んだことをするために、私は高くならなければならなかった」と述べています。したがって、俳優としての彼の浅いアイデンティティは、薬物を介してアイデンティティからの脱出になります。 <br /> <br /> Hongshenの麻薬からの離脱と彼の偽りの生活は非常に緩やかで断続的であり、そして彼自身を忠実に再現しています。孤独、空間、瞑想的思考、スピーチの拒否、治療を置き換える。要約が出ました。そして彼の変化の多くは屋外で起こります---理想的な場所ではなく、主に高速道路、橋、そして北京の高層ビルの下の緑のパッチで起こります。肉体はほとんどロマンチックですが、そうではありません。 Ritan Parkまでの自転車、長い自然散歩、降り注ぐ太陽と雨、草が茂ったピクニック、空のパターン、そして彼の面白さを吸収する凧は非常に特徴的です。彼は到着するためにドリフトし、その間ずっと、より現実的で現実的なアイデンティティへの手がかりを拾っています。 「私は開拓し始めました」と彼はこの時期について振り返って言います。そして、接触は、現在の状況での一種のダンサーの位置付け（不器用、優雅、滑稽、語り）を投影する彼の不機嫌な体から始まるようです。心や精神が不足している場合、彼の足は彼が一晩中歩くことを強いることができます。 <br /> <br />彼のカムバックの中心は、設定された役割の拒否です。彼の演技の終わりと新しいアイデンティティへの決意を際立たせるために、彼は自分のビデオとテレビを粉砕し、彼の「ジョンレノンフォーエバー」ポスターに血が出るまで頭を叩きます。彼は彼の象徴的な反体制派アーティストを失望させました---しかし、彼は彼が知っている唯一の実行可能なガイドです。彼は自分をジョンの息子（小野陽子）と想像し、彼の「暗闇の時間」と「トラブルの時」に彼の「マザー・メアリー」を執り成し者として採用する。 （公園での痛む、震えるような痛み-幻覚とスキッツォイドの試練）「音楽は演技よりもはるかに現実的です」と彼は言う。そして、レノンの影響力を「私に新しい道を示す」と語っています。メンタルインスティテュートでは、命を救うリンゴ（レジスタンス、栄養）がレノンの存在を反映しています。ホンシェンがヒーローのポスターを改装された部屋に再び飾る必要があるのと同じです。<br /> <br />レノンの影響が精神的であれば、ホンシェンの父親の影響が根付いています。父親と息子はどちらも俳優であり、ユーザー（ドラッグとドリンク）ですが、彼の変化を引き受けているのは彼の息子との違いです。父親は自分のほうが安全だ。彼は中国人、農民の農民、農村演劇の監督だと認めているからだ。そして彼は彼の習慣と彼の感情の両方をコントロールします。ホンシェンを、怒りと怒り、時にはユーモア（ブルージーンズ、ビートルズ）と受動性を備えた響板のように扱うように駆り立てるのは、この認識できるアイデンティティです。彼の最も熱狂的で、父親との暴力的なやり取りの中で、彼は彼が嘘つきであり、偽物であると非難している。彼は父親よりも自分自身をさらけ出している。 」そして、ホンシェンは「あなたは私の父ではない」と強調し、「なぜ農民があなたの父親になれないのか」とそっと答えた。 <br /> <br />これらの2人の先生の下で、母親、姉妹、友人、リハビリ院の受刑者からの多くの助けを借りて、彼は本当の（全体ではない）自己に具体的なつながりを築いています。長期的な薬物の影響が後退するにつれて、彼の古いアイデンティティも同様に後退します。借金はプライドに取って代わり、信頼を失います。誠実さは彼の黒い雲を追放します。彼のすべての縁が柔らかくなります。 「あなたはただの人間だ」彼は薬を拒否するために発生したストラップダウンから解放された後、際限なく繰り返されます。家に帰って、ラード農民の石鹸は彼と一緒に元気です。そして、彼のかつての「まれで真の友情」は、彼のミュージシャンの仲間と一緒に後ろから痛烈な背中合わせのフェンスのシーンで明らかであるように、再び始まります。 Hongshenはこの映画について次のように述べています。「私の人生について考える良い機会です。」そして私は、アートと人生に結びつく新しい俳優になるかもしれない。レノンのように、彼はアイデンティティを失うことなく成功を収めました。
"I have watched this film countless times, and have not been fascinated by family simplicity, integrity, and goodness.

"I wouldn't have seen this dedication if I had read Alex Sander (sic)'s review here without seeing a rating of 6 or higher in the selected selection of ignorant viewers. Aliens were fantastic, dramatic and well-made horror/sci-fi. Predator was a great sci-fi/behavior confusion. I've seen'foreigners vs predators', but it's worth blaming myself. It also received an average rating of 6 or higher from movie enthusiasts who frequently visit this site. <br /> <br /> If you are afraid of this, please stop reading now. <br /> /> <br /> From the beginning, this movie was funny. There is no description of Overrun / Overrun of Predator Vessels by Aliens. Perhaps they probably threw aliens to Earth, hunted them, and something was wrong. But how did this become an alien/predator hybrid? And why didn't the rest of the crew realize it faster, despite the great skills? The beginning was actually the most consistent and interesting part of the movie because we had ideas of who, who, what, why and why. From then on, it was really stupid. I always hang my unbelief on the door of the screen and collect it on my way out. I wasn't here. <br /> <br /> The father and son are hunting in the forest. Damaged ship collisions are calculated (from a given point of view) over a distance of 10 miles or more through thick forests. The man and the boy track there alone and hug their faces in search of the ship. Even at this point, I don't usually feel because the face hugs are not scary for their movements and actions, but are almost comical and the father looks irresponsible and a silly red shawl. <br /> <br /> The thriller type scenario is introduced with the former Khon returning to the village near the crash site to meet his emotionless and dull police friend on the bus. When I introduce it I mean a fragile attempt with a trash actor and I don't feel anything. The slasher/horror element is protected with a sexy girl and an ordinary weird or maybe undesirable cute guy, beaten by a crazy, nasty Jock type (American activist, not a Scottish man). Oh, the cute and cute boy is the former Khon brother. That's right. They cleverly have these brothers and sisters with the names I will study to avoid the other shit they put back. Then, in the introduction of the modern role-reversing Ripley credential type character that made a tedious attempt on the PC, a female soldier comes home to her husband and children. <br /> <br /> What will happen next? I'm not going to talk more about the conspiracy that's real (sadly smiles about the disappearance of most of the storytelling in recent movies) in case you're far away and aliens aren't the brightest stars in the innate universe. <br /> <br /> Predators are mentioned in an old poster I read too late.. For one reason is stupid aliens are bored Predators -..?!?! Alien is ridiculous This behavior is sometimes exploitative, rude, disgusting nonsense Pregnant mom and hospital scene Oh, I was shocked what. Are you amazed at what people can get? cowardice? A little shock? Titillate distortion? What? Why isn't it really like to be shocked, not pregnant, expecting a father, or bothering and frightening soulless people instead of swaying aliens/predators instead of killing frightened women and teenage girls? The character has no depth and no plot. Shooting and speed got worse. It is acted by indifferent people that I cannot blame them. It damages two more sets of more interesting and good sci-fi characters. This movie was crap, and if you get pleasure from it, you really have to worry. Decide well if you haven't seen it. <br /> <br /> PS Ah, amateur civilians survive while the soldiers are trained for about 20 seconds.","I wouldn't have seen this blasphemy, rather than just reading a review by Alex Sander (sic) here and seeing a rating of 6 or more from a selection of ignorant audiences.The aliens were nice, dramatic and well-made horror/SF . Predator was a great science fiction/action mess.As I saw ""Alien vs. Predator,"" I really blame myself. It also has an average rating of over 6 stars from the movie enthusiasts who visit this site frequently.<br /> <br /> If you feel like you've never seen a temporary shading that has been broken for you, read it now.<br /> <br /> This movie was ridiculous from the beginning.There was no explanation of the alien presence or absence of predator overruns.OK, maybe they threw the aliens back on earth and went hunting and something went wrong, but why this is an alien/predator hybrid and why other crew members sooner despite their awesome tech Didn't you notice? The start was actually the most consistent and interesting part of the movie, as there were thoughts of who, who, what, and perhaps why. Since then, it's really ridiculous.I always keep my disbelief completely hung above the screen door before coming in and collect it along the way.I couldn't stay here.<br /> < br /> Father and son are hunting in the forest.A damaged ship crash site (from a given view) is calculated to be at least 10 miles away in the thick forest.The man and the boy track alone to find the ship and hug their faces.Even at this point, mostly the facial huggers are rather comical rather than scary in their movements and actions, and feel little to them, as their fathers look like such irresponsible and ridiculous puppets.<br /> <br /> Introducing an edgy, thriller-type scenario where the former Kong returns to the town near the crash site to meet a somewhat emotional and boring cop friend from the bus.When I say introduced, it means a weak attempt with a junk actor, and the feeling isn't staged.Next, the slasher/horror element is introduced with a sexy girl and a regular nerd or perhaps an unwanted cute guy to make it over-protective, crazy, nasty jock-type (non-Scottish American sportsman).Be beaten. Oh, the cute/pretty boy is, by the way, the younger brother of Ex -Kong. Yes, they are these overseer brothers I look up the name to avoid the other shite they give again. Then, like the tedious endeavor on a PC, the modern role is reversed.To introduce Ripley's credential type character, a female soldier goes home to her husband and children.<br /> <br /> Guess what will happen next? For a real plot (sadly laughing about the end of most storytelling endings in recent movies), just in case you've come this far and aren't the brightest stars in the universe on which aliens got I won't explain in detail above...<br /> <br /> Predator is stupid for the reasons stated by previous contributors who posted it too late. Aliens are boring. Predator Aliens are ridiculous. The act is sometimes exploitative, unfair, and nasty nonsense. A hospital scene w ith a pregnant woman? !?! Oh, it was fine. Are you shocked at what some people go to get? scared? shock? How to stimulate the twist? what? If you want to shock, upset, and scare anyone who is not pregnant or who doesn't expect a father, or who doesn't have a soul, instead of an alien/predator killing a sassy woman and a teenage girl ,How about just biting? The text has no depth and no plot. Shooting And poor pace.It's not that I can't blame them, but it's acted by indifferent people.In addition, it hurt a set of two interesting and funny science fiction characters.This movie was trash, and if you get the fun out of it, I really have to worry about you.<br /> <br /> PS Did you also mention how all the trained soldiers are killed in about 20 seconds while the amateurs survive?"
"When I was a kid, I watched this movie, but I already knew the story of the famous group of thieves and Shepherd Wilde who escaped from New Gate Prison. The film faithfully follows the real story.

"Most Americans know little about his work outside of Star Wars, but Alec Guinness has produced amazing works, especially from dramas to quirky comedies. I especially like his comedy because it looks so good and natural and realistic in movies. It's very different from the Hollywood fare. <br /> <br /> This movie became interested in this movie. The plot is so strange and cute that it's unlikely that the movie had a special affection for ""small"" movies like this one, except for Ealing Studios. <br /> <br /> A small, surviving scientist who works for the Guinness Textile Company. He doesn't work as a researcher at the company and wants to experiment to make synthetic fibers that can't be destroyed for cleaning! So he tends to sneak into the lab (nobody in doubt or day to day) and try to invent. Repeatedly, he was caught (after blasting the lab) and booted until one day he actually succeeded! And despite the importance of discovery, he began a series of unexpected events. And the fun begins. <br /> <br /> Movies are a great satire that makes fun stand out in industry, unions, and government, and in general people.","Most Americans have little knowledge of his work outside of Star Wars, but Alec Guinness produced some great work, from dramas to whimsical comedies, especially in the 1940s and 1950s.I especially like his comedy, which is very well done and looks so natural and real on the screen, which is a lot different from the regular fares, especially from Hollywood.<br /> <br /> As allegedly, this sparked interest in these films.The plot was weird and cute, so films were rarely made everywhere except at Ealing Studios, which especially liked these ""small"" movies.<br /> <br /> A small nerdy scientist working at the Guinness Textile Company.

"Victor McLaglen's performance is one of the finest in the history of the film. <br /> <br /> I think we can feel ""Gypo"" because we all fought against right and wrong. This was one of the first art house photos released by major American studios (RKO Radio Pictures). <br /> <br /> The shooting of Joseph H. August is the best. However, the surprising part of August was largely overlooked. He did not receive the Oscar for which he deserves it.<br /> <br />","Victor McGurren's performance is one of the greatest in movie history.<br /> <br /> I think everyone can feel ""Gypo"".

"? How do you put together experienced and well-known actors to make such a silly film? Things are quickly released. With a plot like this, you'd think it would not be so bad, at least in action movies. However, during the first 40 minutes or more of this film, we see what looks like six ordinary, everyday people. They joke, laugh, and drink a few drinks. Then, we suddenly realize that they are planning to take their business. Hero Ty (Columbus Short) is a veteran, a cool guy, and a trustworthy employee who's made up for a cold and brutal world, but he's in a plan. Oh my, oh my! Then, during the last 40 minutes of the movie, these former full-time employees almost all turned their money into enthusiastic psychopaths, lending money to each other. In the final scene, Mike (Matt Dillon) commits suicide for no other reason than killing a previous friend. Viewers didn't get a hint that these people were ruthless and bloodthirsty before this ending. It's completely unbelievable and ""B Movie"" is almost too kind for this kind of cheese plot. I will tell you not to waste your time. No one gave the same advice to Laurence Fishburne, Jean Reno or Fred Ward before making this painting.","How do you take the cast of an experienced and famous actor and put together such a stupid movie?

"The explosive film era of the late 60s and early 70s began with rude nudity in mainstream movies, ending with the legalization of hardcore porn. It was the peak of 1968-1972. One of the most beloved and talented actresses of this era was Monica Gale, who had small but fanatical followers. She was able to actually act unlike many of the protagonists of these films, and subsequent credits proved it. And when her career began, she intentionally vanished. <br /> <br /> Gary Graver, director, was also a talent.

"Known primarily for his swashbuckling role (and his bedroom antics!), Flynn takes a different tack from this movie and works beautifully. Flynn, who plays the real boxing champion Jim Corbett, starts a fascinating job, from a banker in San Francisco to a famous scholar. He and his best friend Carson attend an illegal knuckle fight and are arrested along with other men and dogs, including a prominent judge. The next day, through Smith, I had the opportunity to enter the judge's private club. He took advantage of this opportunity to enjoy the good grace of exclusive members and to become the club's resident boxer. The uniquely skilled skills in his sport soon took all the players, including world champion John L. Sullivan (Bond.). He is the epitome of charm, charisma and charm in this role. He looks great (especially in his head-down, white union suit and hangover scene) and does almost all his stunt work (emotionally!). wacky. Smith sheds class and taste in every pore and goes well with Flynn. At this stage, he needed a female costar to withstand his progress and fame (he was accused of rape at the time) and she did so well. She was repulsed with freshness and carelessness, but she will not fall into the magic of magic. The bond is incredibly rough, blatant, and towering, but soft when the script asks for it. Young and youthful Carson provides interesting support. Frawley is Flynn's manager and is incredibly confident. The rest of the cast, including Flynn's arrogant family and the huge number of Nob Hill types, is also great. Everything is beautifully appointed and safely instructed. Several sets are presented surprisingly. Some of Smith's gowns are gorgeously decorated, but she fits very well with her swept hairstyle. A glimpse into the early days of championship boxing, but much more. Some of them (like Flynn's character traits) have been improved or exaggerated for entertainment purposes, but many are authentic (such as the methods and costumes in the fight scene). One line is especially memorable. ""I like me more than I like you, but the possibility of loving you more than you love me is entirely possible."" It's a classic romantic conversation (and a few signs scattered throughout the script).","Flynn (and his antics in his bedroom!), primarily known for his swashbuckling role, took another tack with this film, which works beautifully.Playing the actual boxing champion Jim Corbett, Flynn is a huge inspiration for the San Francisco bank tellers and well -known novelists. He and his close friend Carson took part in an illegal bare-handed fight and were arrested with many other men (and dogs!), including a prominent judge.The next day you will have the opportunity to enter the judge's private club through Smith. He took the opportunity to step into the elegance of the dedicated members and earn the club's resident boxer status. His extraordinarily skilled sports skills soon lead him to take over all competitors, including world champion John L. Sullivan (Bond). He is the epitome of charm, charisma and charm in this role.He looks great (especially in a hangover scene with his hair fluffy and wearing a white union suit) performing virtually all his stunt work (impressively!). Picably. Smith exudes class and taste from all pores and goes well with Flynn.At this stage, he needed a female co-star who could confront his progress and reputation (at that time he was accused of statutory rape). She hates his freshness And carelessness, but inevitably falls into his fascinating spell. Bond is incredibly powerful, robust and towering, but kind when the script demands it.Entertaining support is provided by a young and courageous Carson. Flory is his dependable glutton self as Flynn's manager.The rest of the cast is equally good, including an assortment of Flynn's wild families and the choking Nob Hill type.The whole is beautifully appointed and well instructed.Some of the sets are surprisingly presented.Some of Smith's gowns come in contact with the girlish, but they fit very well with an upward hairstyle.It's a great glimpse of the early days of championship boxing, but it's not the only one.Some of them (like the character characteristics Flynn shows) have been expanded or exaggerated for entertainment purposes, but many are real (like the methods and outfits shown in battle scenes).I like me more than you, but it's quite possible that I love you more than you love me.

"In the sex, family, and Beverly Hills milk classes, the loudly funny play often laughs more in the zip code than I've seen since the time of my grandmother and Jed Clam ett. The plot focuses on two drivers, one of which can be an employer (alone or soon to be a single woman -Bisset and Woronov). If Manuel wins, his friend owes the violent Asian street gang. <br /> <br /> Lots of dirty conversations, quite painful physical humor, and more. However, many comedies are just below the surface. Bartel is memorable as a very sensual order member of the family who gives birth to his sexy and teenage nephew on a ""missionary trip"" to Africa for a year. <br /> <br /> Fun fun.","Often laughs out loud, funny play in sex, family and Beverly Hills classes. More laughter from the zip code than seen since the days of Grandma and Jeddrumpet. The plot revolves around two chauffeurs, either of whom can be the first to sleep his employer (single or soon single ladies-Bisset and Woronov). If Manuel wins, his friend repays debt to a violent Asian street gang-if he loses, he must bottom man his friend! <br /> <br /> There are lots of obscene conversations and humor that makes me feel really bad. But much of the comedy is subsurface. Impressive as a member of a very sensual family, Bartell takes her sexy teenage niece on a one-year ""missionary trip"" to Africa. <br /> <br /> Cheerful fun."
"A provocative and modest portrayal of human war tragedy. A small but altruistic view of the interaction between a family and an enemy during the Kentucky Civil War.

It shows that it affects not only the soldiers, but also the whole family. <br /> <br /> Many movies of the day show war as an opportunity to highlight ""heroes"" and other fascinating war features, but rarely try. It really shows the real impact of war on the community. The film tries to do this through a story about the memory of a person at the time.

"I watched this movie on the Hallmark channel and thought it was great, especially because it was based on a true person. Pierce Brosnan was very good as an alien Englishman who played the persona of a half-breed gray owl. The picture was beautiful. <br /> <br /> This movie led to further study of this character, known as the Gray Owl, Archie Belaney. I want to read as much as possible about it. At the time, I didn't know what Richard Attenborough ordered. But I am not surprised. I like all his movies whether he is acting or directing. I gave the highest grade. But I would have wanted to see more in the movie about why he took this persona.

"Despite having an absolutely terrible script, the film is vaguely watched by two actors, Barbara Stanwick and Henry Fonda. Except for one or two REAL stickers, you're probably an avid fan of the golden age of Hollywood in the 1930s and 40s, so you've probably seen everything related to it in movies. However, no matter how much you like it, I can't recommend it. <br /> <br /> The film starts with Fonda and Stanwyck, who start their vacation at a ski resort. The two haven't met yet, but the movie begins with a horrible yodel scene as Fonda skis. It was done subtly and made my teeth sharp, but I stopped this, especially when Fonda fell into the snow bank. On the scale, it was probably just off! Fonda falls in the fall and Barbara calls for help. He seems to be okay when he comes back to the ski resort, but fortunately she is also a doctor, getting an x-ray and taking care of a nurse for health. He, in turn, is keen on her and suggests to her. Little did they know each other, but they were married and so far the movie looks sweet, but very little romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> When he gets home, the family doctor and he start to show signs of being jealous and potentially dangerous because of their jealousy. The movie plays everything for laughter, but honestly Fonda's actions spy on her and her male patients, attack or threaten the ones she treats, knock over patients who are already injured and fall into a surprise party All people (boys and girls) took their wives. He comes out with a combination of sociopath and paranoid schizophrenia, but everyone will laugh. Considering that he looks like a dangerous nut, Stanwyck will think he will apply for a nullification with a redemption order! But, strangely, she was angry, but Fonda was angry and couldn't get angry. I can't think of the right word. I only think of'Creepy'! Later, millions of millionaire Fonda got a job at a department store counter. Then, through a magician, he and Babs seem to assume that his hostility and violent jealousy are all past. Therefore, the job clearly cures anger and suspicion. At the end of the job, the movie Fonda buys her hospital, gives Barbara a job and eventually lives happily. They don't go any further, but depending on Fonda's personality, assume that the hospital manager has spent most of his time hitting all male patients. <br /> <br /> The first part of the ski lodge did not fit well with the next, and there was no final ""Horatio Alger"" inspiration section where the rich boy had good results in the business world. They were like three plots, but nevertheless, the most serious problem of the movie is to excuse domestic violence and delusions! A really creepy little movie! Fonda and Stanwyck","There are absolutely horrifying screenplays (more on this later), but the movie still stares in vagueness because it stars two excellent actors, Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda.Being a big fan of the golden age of Hollywood in the 1930s and 40s, I would probably see almost anything with them in the movie, except for one or two REAL stench. But no matter how much I love their movie, I can't recommend it.<br /> <br /> The movie begins with Fonda and Stanwick on vacation at several ski resorts.The two haven't met yet, but the movie is loud and unpleasant, beginning with a scene where Fonda is terribly yodeling while skiing.It was done so vulgarly and smashed my teeth, but I stuck it out -especially when Fonda fell into a snowbank and this stopped Yodel!! Looking back, maybe I think it was Should have been turned off! Fonda is knocked out in the fall and Barbara calls for help.When he returns to the ski lodge, he looks okay, but fortunately she is also a doctor, taking a radiograph of him to bring him back to good health. Then he becomes obsessed with her and offers her.Despite knowing little about each other, they got married and for now the film looks like a sweet but very slight romantic comedy.<br /> <br /> /> When I returned home, she returned to work immediately, so it's not rosy. His family doctor and he begin to show signs of being a dominant and potentially dangerous man because of his jealousy.The movie is all laughing, but frankly, Fonda's behavior was really creepy-spying her and her male patients, attacking and threatening the men she was dealing with. They stumble over patients who already have back injuries, step into surprise parties, and make claims. Everyone there (male and female) is trying He breaks out as a combination of socialist and paranoid schizophrenia, all for laughter. Given that he seems like a dangerous nut, you think Stanwick will apply for destruction with a restraining order! Oddly enough, though she's angry, hecan't keep going mad at Fonda.I can't think of the right words-""creepy"" is all that comes to mind! Then suddenly, millions of millionaire fondas get a job working at a department store counter. Then, through his magical thoughts, he and the Babs seem to assume that hostility and violent jealousy are all past.As such, work clearly heals anger and doubt.If this job fails, the movie shows that Fonda purchases his hospital, gives Barbara a job there, and They live happily forever. They can't go any further, but I think based on Fonda's personality, he spent most of his time defeating all male patients as a hospital administrator.<br /> <br /> The first lodge of skis didn 't go well with the lodge next, and the section inspired by the rich boy's last successful ""Horatio Alger"" in the business world didn't work either.It was They seemed to be three separate plots, but nevertheless, the most serious problem with the film was that it seemed unacceptable for domestic violence and delusional jealousy! What an eerie little movie! Thank you. Neither Fonda nor Stanwick are known for this naughty movie, but for all the other nice movies."
"I know that criticism of many IMDb users is a bit harsh, and in many cases I find that they criticize movies from a very professional point of view, not from people on the street who just want to sit on the street and see something. <br /> <br /> But in this case you have to say that it is wrong.

"I was discussing between this film and 2012, but I chose Inglourious Basterds due to its surprisingly high IMDb rating. I must be disappointed now. I expected some violence, but I also needed a lot of witty conversation. I have gained a lot of the former, but the latter is not enough. I felt lacking. The ratio of violence and conspiracy is very important and I think this film is completely wrong. And conspiracy? It is reliable or really fun.

"In short, there is a hole that is longer and filled with more sub-floats than Swiss cheese! The director and co-writer said he wanted to mix genres (in this case, drama and comedy). Well, at least these two vinegars and cooking oil are mixed. Comedy to boot is not fun and not a youth. Also, the movie is not really realistic. Freedom is given to the legal system of committing French citizens against the will of the French citizens and the apparent ease of use of drugs in French hospitals. I watched this movie on my home's big screen TV, watched it and shouted at myself. Eventually, I quickly delivered the last long speech one of the last protagonists gave to his ex-lover's son. Until then, I was worn by a ridiculously chaotic conspiracy dealing with dead lovers, convenience marriages, and full-fledged lovers. Sometimes the plot goes back to the family of the two main characters and then to either Ishmael or mainly Nora. To harm the audience, her ex-lover is constantly changing perspectives at Nora and Ishmael, who are confined to his will at the mental hospital. There will be two potentially interesting movies here. Epilogue doesn't actually wrap up a lot of sub-plots, and it seems that viewers want Nora to believe that given the situation in reality, chances are somehow to find happiness even if the chances are equal to the chance of a snowball in hell. The actors do their best and appeal, but not enough to overcome all the glaring flaws caused by lack of writing, editing and concentration.","In short, it's longer than a hole in Swiss cheese and full of subplots!

He captures the essence of that personality. At the same time, it is a very dangerous and refined perfect combination. Unfortunately, the film itself was disappointing. Much of the story didn't seem to match. The first was the idea that the police would not enter Kasbah. It was quite clearly mentioned by the local commander at the beginning of the movie, but repeated mentions in the movie actually suggest that the police entered fairly fairly regularly in Kasbah. Thus, the police's entry proposal by Chairman Janvier or the statement by Attorney Slimane (a great performance by Joseph Calleia) seemed to make them get into Casbah but not much. It was also hard to believe that Le Moko-the criminal mind-was strengthened by Hedy Lamarr, singing love songs, giving pleasure to the local public and sweeping her feet quickly until she left Kasbah, essentially looking for her . Give yourself up. Of course I understand the irony of the last few scenes because Pepe is leaving his prison freedom to find the true freedom of his arrest because Pepe was shot and killed by the police. I believe someone like le Moko will fall into that trap. 3/10","Played by Charles Boyer, Pepermoko is the mastermind of some of the sought after international crimes across Europe, and even the police don't want to go to stay free in Kasbah, a mysterious part of Algiers. A senior official is sent from Paris to In the case of Rumoko, Casva allows him to remain outside police detention, but it can also be a sort of prison at the same time-the moment he leaves, he knows he will be arrested, so He Is a place where he cannot leave.<br /> <br /> Boyer's performance is good and you can see why he was nominated for an Oscar. He captures the essence of such characters-a very dangerous and at the same time a very. Elegant and perfect combination. Unfortunately, the movie itself was quite disappointing. Many parts of the story seemed inconsistent, but I'll cover two of them. At first, the idea was that the police would not enter Kasbah. It was stated quite clearly by the local commander at the beginning of the movie, and yet r epeated mentions of the movie suggest that police actually entered Casbah quite regularly. I not immediately so meaningful.Was broken.I also immediately wiped it off by Gabby (Hedy Lamar) to the point where Rumoko, who solidified the mastermind of the crime he was, sang a love song to entertain the locals and then left Kasbah. I found it hard to believe that I could do it, and essentially give up on myself to find her. Of course, Pepe left the freedom of prisons (Casbah) and made it impossible just to find the true freedom of captivity (since he was shot dead by the police).I believe someone like Rumoko will fall into such a trap.<br /> <br /> This is worth seeing to Boyer, and to a lesser extent Kaleia, but the story is disappointing and inconsistent. 3 /Ten"
"A person with a screaming brain is definitely not a perfect movie, but it couldn't have been more than Bruce Campbell's star vehicle. That is used as a summary of his entire career. Satire, cheese, action and a happy ending. Campbell is an uneven artist. There are a lot of things in the story that don't make sense (why is the robot implanted in the female brain and the robot suddenly catches the chest)? The scene of the restaurant to fight for is coming straight from Evil Dead II). However, there are a lot of touches and non-manipulators that feel a bit glamorous, such as when William is panic and screams at the statue. ""What are you watching?!"" The movie probably looks like the original Sci-Fi Channel. Acting is actually pretty good. I especially enjoyed Tamaya Gorta as Tatoya. She was merciless and cunning. But it seemed to have a tragic mood for her at certain moments when the story was never explored. Ted Raimi has fully taken on the standard ""Bumbling Assistant"" role, and Bruce is fun with an arrogant, apathetic, chaotic American jerk. (Now he's writing his own movie, so you'll think he'll take on a role he hasn't already typed in.) A man with a screaming brain is a delightful and meaningless B movie.

"You shouldn't be trying to watch this movie! Absolutely terrible! This is not an exaggerated expression!! It's so unbelievable and exaggerated and boring.

"This movie was interested enough to watch it many times. There are holes in the plot, but the main performers work. <br /> <br /> Catherine Mary Stewart (Julia Kerbridge) is a 37-year-old woman who is a great woman who sacrificed everything else to become a doctor. She worked several years to make money to go to medical school. She is performing well in the resident and will soon take the board exam and try to fulfill her dream. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Julia's sister and daughter-in-law are murdered and forced into closest relatives, nephew Amanda. (Allen Agua Yo-Stuart) brought her to avoid becoming a national ward Amanda is about 7 years old in her appearance. Amanda was muted because she was so traumatized by her parents' murder. Needless to say, Julia's 16 hours will take care of Amanda longer. <br /> <br /> Roblow plays Kevin Finney, a charming neighbor who walks his way in the life of Julia and Amanda. He is always there as a trick or joke to help Amanda deal with her pain. Amanda began to get warmer to Kevin, perhaps more than her aunt, as the film progressed. Julia begins to rely on Kevin to handle Kevin's case load and take care of Amanda when preparing for board inspection. Whenever a crisis strikes Julia, Kevin is always there. <br /> <br /> Rob and Catherine Mary's chemistry was great. I watch them gather together before the movie ends. The chemistry of Rob and Arlen was also excellent. Allen was able to deliver many things without the benefit of words. The plot and Julia and Amanda gradually warmed each other. As the movie progresses, you can see that they have a relationship. <br /> <br /> We found Julia's sister and daughter-in-law (Meyers) involved in an industrial spy activity. They stole a very valuable prototype microchip from an employer. They had three employees trying to share their theft. Julia discovered that the Meyers were planning to skip the country with their supposed identity. It's unclear if Myers was trying to double his colleagues, or double himself. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Meyer is killed at home by two of her former colleagues. The killer does not attempt to extract the location of the microchip from Meyer before killing Meyer. The murderer searches the house and finds no prize. They left a living witness to the crime, Amanda murderers clumsy trying to extract microchips from Julia and Amanda for the rest of the movie and don't know where the prize is. Eventually, the murderers kidnap Amanda and want to know the location of the microchip. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Julia learns the truth about Kevin. He is an investigator hired to recover a stolen microchip. At the moment of the relationship, they rescued Amanda and sent out bad guys. The predictable ending has three things that make a family and happily move forward together. <br /> <br /> It was a big hole that surprised me about this plot. The day after Kevin's murder, Kevin moves to an apartment building like Julia and Amanda. How can he know that the microchip is not yet in the hands of the killer? The murderer does not have to worry about leaving fingerprints and hiding his identity at the murder scene. The murderer, who pretends to be a psychiatrist, is revealed to Amanda by the remains of red paint in the murder scene of the shoe sole. He did not appear on the murder scene when the movie began. There are too many other weaknesses in this line to mention. <br /> <br /> If you had further refined the script before filming, the movie would have been much better. Filling the plot cost little, and the effort was greatly improved.","This movie was interesting enough to watch several times.There is a hole in the plot, but the main actor makes it work.<br /> <br /> Catherine Mary Stewart (Julia Carbridge) does a great job as a 37-year -old woman who sacrificed everything else to become a doctor.

"Spoilers can be included. This movie was the worst. I couldn't even see everything that was too bad. This movie is actually worse than the scarecrow Slayer.

"I watched a movie last night, and I was obsessed with a heartfelt storyline, excellent character development, acting and a good karma atmosphere from the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It starts with an ordinary commute commuting to a routine workplace inspired to take dance lessons. Learn a lesson about yourself with others while meeting the protagonist and various characters to be smooth on the dance floor. <br /> <br /> This story has a prologue about what Japanese dance symbolizes sociologically, so learning dance in Japan is not as simple as it is in the United States.<br /> <br /> Movie The mind is bright. You will laugh out loud in some of the sight gags. But it is also majestic in a way that is difficult to describe. All the characters in the film are taken seriously as they are, and ""imperfection"" never diminishes anyone. A friend lent me a video about learning to dance. Is this synchronous or what? I think so because I am so glad to try it now. <br /> <br /> Watch this wonderful family movie (little kids might not get it, but teenagers will definitely do it). The remake of Shall We Dance is perfect.","After watching this last night, I was fed up with a heartfelt storyline, good character development, and a good karmic atmosphere from the acting and the whole movie.<br /> <br /> Without giving too much of a plot, it starts with an ordinary Joe who goes to his office work every day who gets inspired to take dance lessons.Learn lessons about yourself with others along the way of the hero and the different characters that he meets in his quest to be smooth on the dance floor. <br /> <br /> Learning to dance in Japan is easier here than in the United States, as the story has a prologue about what sociologically symbolizes dance in Japan.Not<br /> <br /> Movies are easy.

"Summary:.. The mysterious density of transmitting radio signals from the ice of Antarctica has been discovered. A mysterious block has been unearthed and transferred to the laboratory of Antarctica. The situation is quickly becoming awkward because one of the researchers is his old girlfriend, especially the other female researchers actually throwing at him. And ice cubes with objects inside are melting unnaturally and quickly. Soon the object is open. The mystery continues as objects generate huge amounts of electricity. I decided to open the object, but just before completion Julian decoded the signal. ""Don't open"". But it was too late, and the object finally exploded as it broke, and two things poured into the earth. The first is an alien, dormant in the subject, the other is a virus that kills researchers immediately. And Washington, questionably updated about this historic event, decides that such things cannot be released on Earth. Thus, Russia's nuclear submarine, which carries nuclear weapons, is sent to Antarctica. One is Carl Lewis with an amazingly good acting performance, and the other is a special effect that is beautiful, works well, and is much better than expected. Unfortunately the story itself brings a lot of surprises, but this is not a good way to do this. In fact it is full of plot holes, so sometimes the movie seems to consist of almost randomly linked scenes. It is not explained why Washington knows so much, why Washington can command a Russian submarine, and why the object was in Antarctica and is now awake. It's really embarrassing to send in English that alien Ford can understand. Some people would like to explain that aliens came to Earth before and knew the language (and why did they choose English?). But it's very confusing why the awesome aliens who apparently want to save the planet from viruses encoded the message ""Don't open""! And finally, the end is open as much as it can be. <br /> <br /> The movie is a bit fun, but too much energy (from me) has to be switched to fill the empty space of the plot. So the total impression of the movie is so good","Summary: Something mysteriously dense that transmit radio signals was found on the Antarctic ice.A mysterious block was unearthed and taken to a research base in Antarctica.Former SETI worker Julian Roma was brought in to decipher the message. researchers is his old lover, and the situation quickly becomes awkward, especially as other female researchers actually throw him at him.And the lump of ice that contains things is melting unnaturally and rapidly.The object will be published soon.The mystery continues, as It was decided to open the object, but just before that happened, Julian would decode the signal.

"If you've checked the IMDb before renting this DVD on Netflix, my life has been back for hours. When the film director also wrote, I am honestly suspicious. In this case, according to the credit, the same person was ""writing and supervising"". Unfortunately there were some interesting moments that indicate the overall quality of this production. (Example: Judy Tenuta's scene reminded me of an early comedy routine that promoted Judy-ism) but rated these two stars as not one. There weren't many moments... and I rarely saw them because the passionate sequence was hard to understand for me and to say nothing that violence could not see. I admit I went to see that part again to see that when I saw all that part, I missed something that might help me figure it out. No, at least I knew later who the character was and I knew it was important. The ""rotating camera"" technology was overused and essentially meaningless.

"The same is true for independent low-budget films. Perhaps you can't even believe Troma will throw out such trash. I was a fan of some Troma movies.

Unemployed street people who might be good... oh wait, that's what they did. These characters have a negative charisma. Special Effects As with people, beyond terrible acting and terrible special effects, the conversation is absolutely shocking to the ears. The script has Alaska-sized pubic holes and has serious continuity issues. But the worst part is that you can't have fun in a very small way.

"This is a very memorable western spaghetti. Especially Rosalba Neri's great story, funny characters and very good acting. Her role as an evil villain in this film is truly classic. She steals every scene she is confident in and expresses a lot with her face and eyes even when she is not speaking. Her performance is very reliable. She is not at the top and is quite fascinating (no problem with being on top). Mark Damon is amazingly good in this movie too. <br /> <br /> The music score is excellent, and the theme song is the kind that is played continuously in the head regardless of whether you want it after watching the movie. ~ In. There are some very interesting parts. I especially like where Rosalba Neri takes off his clothes in front of the parrot. There are also a lot of very good smooth firearms. <br /> <br /> If this movie wasn't two, it would have given me eight to nine stars. The first is a silly bar room fight that takes place for about 25 minutes on the film. This is one of the most ridiculous fights I have seen in the movie. It is very bad choreography and looks like a dance number of musicals that is worse than any kind of real fight. A Terrence Hill/Bird Spencer comedy might overlook this, but this is more serious Western and the fight has to be made more realistic. Another thing that upset me in this movie was Yuma's cowardly Mexican assistant. I thought he was a cartoon relief or something else, but the character was just stupid and unnecessary at all in movies like this. What I can say is where is Tuco when you need him? <br /> <br /> With all that said, despite the flaws I mentioned, everyone will read that Johnny Yuma is a classic spaghetti western in the West and all fans of this genre need to watch this movie.","This is a very impressive Western spaghetti. It has a great storyline, interesting characters, and some very good acting especially from Rosalba Neri. Her role as an evil villain in this movie is really classic. She steals all the scenes she has and expresses a lot with her face and eyes, even if she isn't talking. I can really believe her performance. She's somehow fascinated by not going up (it's not that there's anything wrong with it). Marc Damon is also surprisingly good at this movie. <br /> <br /> Whether the score is great and the theme song is a kind that is constantly played in my head for days after I watch the movie. There are some very interesting parts. I especially like the part where Losalva Neri undresses in front of the parrot. There is also a lot of very good and clever gun play. <br /> <br /> If you didn't have a dual purpose, you probably gave the movie an 8 or 9 star. The first is the stupid barroom brawl that occurs in about 25 minutes of the movie. This is one of the most silly looking fights I've ever seen in a movie. It is very poorly choreographed and looks like a musical dance number that is worse than the actual fight type. A Terence Hill/Bad Spencer comedy could be overlooked, but this was a more serious western drama and the fight had to be more realistic. Another frustrating me about this movie was Yuma's cowardly Mexican buddy. I think he was supposed to be a comical relief or something, but in such movies the characters were simple stupid and unnecessary, and he wasn't funny at all. Where is Tuco all I can say when you need him? <br /> <br /> Explaining all of the above, Johnny Yuma is a classic spaghetti western despite the drawbacks I mentioned, and every fan of the genre needs to watch this movie. I assure everyone reading this."
"summary:. Michael Linnett Connors has dealt with everything in the film directly and is looking for the first big opportunity. He finds Molly in the play and knows at once that she will be a big movie star. Contracted with regulations. Producers agree and their great career is going on. The following are the reproductions of the silent film era and early sound films with a focus on comedy. And yes. There is romance and a little sadness. Don Ameche and Alice Fay perform best. Music is a plus with familiar old songs. This restored version, released in 2008, also has many DVD extras. It should be emphasized that this film is the first story, not a tribute to a silent film. Over the next few years, it will bring similar films such as Singin'in the Rain (1952) and Dick Van Dyke-Carl Reiner's, The Comic (1969). However, the special thing about this film is playing a silent film in 1939. We have film audiences glorious black and white from past movies (some sound effects are included), and the rest of the movies are clean colors. One of the greatest in a quiet era, Buster Keaton, who climbed uphill at this point, is great for two silent movie playback scenes and is at the top of the game! He says there are some opinions in his scene. But if you're a movie history fan, the real reason to watch a movie is that Hollywood Cavalry Cade is Mack Sennett's film heritage. Reality is not necessary to realize that this film is a ""positive"" rework of the lives of Mack Sennett and Mabel Normand. The character Michael ""Linnett"" Connors is Mack Sennett, his real name is Michael Sinnott. And Molly, of course, is Mabel. Sennett has a pie throwing, bathing beauty and Keystone Cops. He fell in love with his main wife, working with Buster Keaton, Ben Tourfin (cameo), and Roscoe ""Pati"" Ah Buckle (body double). Not only that, Sennett was a technical advisor to the film and also appeared in the film. Today, most movie viewers prefer sound features, so people with shorter subjects and silence don't fall into the pasture. It's lucky to have the Hollywood Cavalcade when Mack Sennett entered the category! Sennett, of course, played a very important role in the evolution of comedy in the film. His career began in 1908 as an actor, writer, director and producer. He retired in 1935 with about 500 movies. He worked with tops like Charlie Chaplin, Gloria Swanson, Bing Crosby, and WC. Field, Keaton, Harry Langdon, Arbuckle, and In Way Up Thar film comedies are extremely difficult ways to continue your entire career, so Mac played wisely and did only selective work over the next 25 years. In 1931 he won the Academy Award in the short subject category and in 1937 worked for a lifetime. Even in the 1940s, his presence was still felt. Here comes Coed (1945), a reproduction of the oyster soup scene used in Max Wondering Willis (1926). In 1947, The Road to Hollywood used Sennett's Crosby film. Two years later, he made nostalgia for his movie Down Memory Lane. With his tips to always be with the right people, the ever-popular Lawrence Welk & guest role in his radio show came out later this year. In 1950, his biggest victory, Tilly's Astral Romance (1914) was re-released. In 1952, he was honored on TV'This Is Your Life' and his autobiography, King of Comedy (1954), was a great companion to Hollywood's Caval Cade. In 1955, while playing cameo at A&C, I met Keystone Coffs and became more specific with Abbott & Costello. Finally, in 1957, it became another tribute to the editorial film The Golden Age of Comedy. It's a legacy of movie pioneers when watching the Hollywood Cavalcade. In banquet hall movies, the camera moves over the guests at the long table. When we arrived at the silver hair Mack, he said, ""I am here!"" As if saying, turn your head with the camera. When I woke up to give a speech after a while, he spoke as if he were speaking his mind mentally, and was in the most conquered state of prosperity.",筋書き：マイケル・リネット・コナーズは映画ですべてを成し遂げましたが、直接であり、彼の最初の大きなチャンスを探しています。彼は劇中でモリーを発見し、すぐに彼女が大きな映画スターになることを知っています。彼は彼に指示しなければならない規定の契約に彼女に署名します。プロデューサーは同意し、彼らの大きなキャリアが進んでいます。続くのは、コメディを重視したサイレント映画時代と初期のサウンド映画の再現です。そして、そうそう、ロマンスと少し悲しみもあります。ドン・アメッシュとアリス・フェイのパフォーマンスは一流です。音楽はまた、いくつかの古いおなじみの曲が聞こえた本当のプラスです。 2008年にリリースされたこの復元されたバージョンには、DVDエキストラもたくさんあります。この映画はストーリー1であり、サイレントフィルムへのオマージュではないことを強調しておく必要があります。晩年は、「雨の中のシンギン」（1952）やディックヴァンダイクカールライナーの「コミック」（1969）などの同様の映画が登場します。しかし、この映画の特別な点は、1939年にサイレント映画を再現することです。映画の観客が過ぎ去った時代（一部の音響効果は含まれています）のように、一部は輝かしい白黒で見られ、残りの映画は自然な色。無声時代の最高傑作の1つである、現時点で上り坂を登っていたバスターキートンは、2つの無声映画の再現シーンで見事に使用され、ゲームの頂点に立っています。彼はまた、彼のシーンにもいくつかの入力をしたと言われています。しかし、映画を観る本当の理由は、もしあなたが映画史のファンなら、何よりもハリウッドキャバルケードがマックセネットの映画の遺産であることです。この映画がマックセネットとメイベルノーマンドの人生を「前向きに」リワークしたものだと気づくのに天才は必要ありません。キャラクターのマイケル「リネット」コナーズはマックセネットで、本名はマイケルシノットです。そしてモリーはもちろんメイベルです。セネットには、パイ投げ、水着の美女、キーストーン警官がいました。彼はバスターキートン、ベンターピン（カメオ）、ロスコー「ファッティー」アーバックル（ボディダブル）と一緒に働き、彼の主役の女性と恋に落ちました。それだけでなく、セネットはこの映画の技術顧問であり、その中にも出演しています。今日のほとんどの映画視聴者はサウンド機能を好むので、短い主題とサイレントに関連していた人々は放牧されません。マックセネットがそのカテゴリに分類されたとき、ハリウッドキャバルケードがいることは幸運です。もちろん、セネットは映画のコメディの進化に非常に役立ちました。彼のキャリアは1908年に俳優、ライター、ディレクター、プロデューサーとして始まりました。彼は1935年に半引退し、約500本の映画が評価されました。彼はチャーリー・チャップリン、グロリア・スワンソン、ビング・クロスビー、W.C。フィールズ、キートン、ハリーラングドン、アーバックル、さらにはロイロジャーズ（ウェイアップタール）まで。映画コメディはキャリア全体を続けるには非常に難しい道なので、マックはそれを賢く演じ、次の25年間は選択的な仕事しかしませんでした。 1931年に彼は短い主題カテゴリでアカデミー賞を受賞し、1937年には生涯の作品賞を受賞しました。 1940年代、彼の存在はまだ感じられていました。ここでは、マックのワンダリングウィリーズ（1926）で使用されているオイスタースープシーンの再現が行われる共同編集（1945）が行われます。 1947年、ハリウッドへの道はセネットのクロスビー映画のいくつかを使用しました。 2年後、彼が参加した映画「ダウンメモリーレーン」に懐かしさをもたらしました。常に適切な人々と関わっていた彼の才能により、永遠に人気のローレンスウェルクと彼のラジオ番組でのゲストの役割が今年後半に登場しました。 1950年、彼の最大の勝利であるティリーのパンクチャードロマンス（1914）がサウンドとともに再リリースされました。 1952年にテレビで「This Is Your Life」として表彰され、その後、ハリウッドキャバケードの優れた伴奏曲である自叙伝「キングオブコメディ」（1954年）が出版されました。 1955年には、A＆Cミートザキーストーンコップスにカメオがあったため、アボット＆コステロとより具体的な関係を築きました。最後に1957年、編集映画のもう1つのトリビュート、「喜劇の黄金時代」。したがって、ハリウッドキャバルケードを見ると、それは映画の先駆者の遺産です。宴会シーンの映画では、カメラが長いテーブルでゲストの上をパンします。銀色の髪のマックに着くと、彼は一人で「ここにいるよ」と言うかのようにカメラに頭を向けます。彼がしばらくしてスピーチをするために立ち上がるとき、彼は彼の最も控えめな状態にあり、精神的に伝えるように彼に与えられた言葉を軽視します。「コメディへの私の影響は決して終わりませんが、人々はマックセネットを忘れるでしょう。たぶん、この映画が役立つでしょう。」
"It was a joke around Bonanza how deadly it was for every woman to have a relationship with a Cartwright man. Every Ben Cartwright became three times a widow with his son every time he got married. And the women involved in Adam, Horse, and Little Joe will die because they couldn't remove the formula of the widow and three sons who started this classic TV Western style. <br /> <br Perhaps if Bonanza was done today, the writers probably had a rotating female character entering and exiting Cartwright's life. People are related, some are getting better, some are not good. It's just life.

I cared more about this family than Kennedy. The popularity of Bonanza in syndication testifies to it. <br /> <br /> Fennel Roberts, the eldest son of Adam, was written at the show.

The sudden death after surgery created a hole in the family that was too large. <br /> <br /> Ponderosa's Cartwright has entered history. When I visited the real Virginia City, I got a real taste of what America thought of Cartwright. You don't see anything like what you see in Bonanza. However, near Lake Tahoe, the place where Ponterosa can be seen on the map with opening credits is the Cartwright home, which remains open and remains a tourist attraction. Ranches and cartlights are real, like 21 Baker Street for Sherlock Holmes fans. <br /> <br /> If not real, they should have been.","A joke about Bonanza has been written about how deadly the relationship between men and women in Carton Wright is.After all, Ben Cartwright was three widows with a son in each marriage.And the woman associated with Adam, Hoth, and Little Joe eventually dies because he couldn't get rid of the widows and three sons' ceremonies that started this classic TV western drama.<br /> <br /> Perhaps, if Bonanza had been done today, the writers would have had a spinning female character in And out of Cartwright's life.People are related and some work well, others not so well.It's just life.And we're less demanding on heroes today, so if the relationship with one of them goes south, we don't have to kill that character to keep the surviving nobles intact.But that is the case when today's Bonanza took place.<br /> <br /> However, we were expecting a lot from Western Heroes and Bonanza, but it took a while and the change in viewing time from NBC certainly helped.

"몇 년 전, DARLING LILI가 TV에서 상영되었을 때는 항상 팬 앤 스캔 버전이었습니다. 필자는 그것을 싫어하고 적절한 와이드 스크린 형식으로 영화를보고 싶어했습니다. 그래서이 Julie Andrews / Blake Edwards opus의 저렴한 DVD를 보았을 때, 나는 그것을 한 번에 구입하고보기로 결정했습니다. <br /> <br /> Boy, 정말 끔찍한 영화입니다. 그것은 너무 나쁘고 많은 수준에서 정말 끔찍하게 잘못되는 곳과시기를 설명하기 위해 어디서부터 시작 해야할지 모르겠습니다. 지금, 블레이크 에드워즈가 아내를 위해이 스타 비히클을 제작 한 영화 팬들에게는 많은 다른 감독들이 앤드류와 함께 뮤지컬 (메리 팝핀 스, 사운드 오브 뮤직, THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE 등)에서 금메달을 쳤기 때문에 분명합니다. 할리우드가 그녀가 섹시하거나 화려하지 않다고 생각했기 때문에 Andrews는 Julie 자신 (CAMELOT, MY FAIR LADY 등)이 무대에서 유명하게 만든 프로젝트에서 주연을 맡고 있었기 때문에. 그래서 블레이크는 그의 사악한 스파이 스토리 / 전쟁 영화 / 로맨스 / 슬랩스틱 코미디 / 뮤지컬에서 그의 아내를 보여주기 위해이 사산 한 노력을 만들어 냈습니다. DARLING LILI는 여러 인물로 인해 어려움을 겪고 있으며 누구인지 또는 무엇인지 모릅니다. 일부 특정 장면은 훌륭하거나 효과적이지만 전체적으로 매우 부끄럽다는 점까지는 전혀 효과가 없습니다. <br /> <br /> DVD의 버전은 ""감독의 컷""입니다. "", 또는이 경우에,이 악명 높은 박스 오피스 플롭에서""우리가 할 수있는 모든 것을 구하자 "". DVD를 릴리스 할 때 Edwards는 원래 부풀린 연극 버전의 19 개 장면 (19 !!!!!!!!)을보다 간결하면서도 비효율적 인 버전으로 잘라 냈습니다. 영화는 그것이 무엇인지 전혀 모른다. 우리는 그것에 25 분이고 여전히 무슨 일이 일어나고 있는지 그리고 왜 우리가 무슨 일을보고 있는지 모른다. Lili는 어떤 종류의 스파이입니까? 그녀는 얼마나 강력합니까? 그녀는 누군가의 죽음에 책임이 있습니까? 대신에 우리는 철저하게 지루해 보이는 Rock Hudson을보고 완전히 지루해 보이는 Julie Andrews를 구하려고합니다. 두 사람이 사랑에 빠질 수없는 이유에 대해서는 도움이되지 않습니다. 줄리는 왜 허드슨에 빠지나요? 왜 다른 사람이 아닌 그녀와 관련이 있었습니까? 그녀의 전직원 중 한 명이 걸어 다니거나 그녀를이기려고하거나 비밀을 해독하려고했을 것입니다. 이로 인해 혼란스러운 행동과 대비되는 것이 필요했을 것입니다. 그것은 또한 우리에게 느리게 진행되는 과정에 약간의 자극을 주었을 것입니다. 이 이야기에는 촉매제가 없습니다. <br /> <br /> 에드워즈와 작가가 앤드류스 (및 에드워즈)의 이전 성공에서 영감을 얻은 아이디어를 내놓았다는 것을 분명히 알기 위해 컷 장면을 살펴보기 만하면됩니다. 앤드류스와 허드슨이 숲 한가운데서 노래를 부르는 아이들 그룹을 따르는 장면이 가장 좋습니다. 에드워즈 채널 사운드 사운드. 그가 DVD에서 그것을 제거한 것은 놀라운 일이 아닙니다. 1970 년에 그 장면은 일정 수준에서 작동했을지 모르지만 오늘날 그 순간은 절망에 빠집니다. Andrews / Edwards의 다른 영화에서 직접 영감을 얻은 다른 줄거리 요소가 있습니다. 개싸움의 끝없는 장면은 훨씬 더 현대적인 MILLIE에서 영감을 얻었습니다. 줄리의 MARY POPPINS 페르소나를 놀리기 위해 ""내가 세 가지 추측을하겠습니다""라는 음악적 순간이 만들어졌습니다. 줄리가 허드슨의 비행기를 향해 달려가는 조감도는 SOUND OF MUSIC의 또 다른 윙크입니다. <br /> <br /> 모든 것이 혼란 스럽습니다. 줄리는 독일에 계신 아버지와 영국인 어머니에게서 태어나 영국에 살지만 파리에서는 영어 노래를 부릅니다. 당신은 이야기가 어디에서 일어나는지 정확히 알지 못합니다. 일부 순간이 잘못 편집되었습니다. 줄리와 그녀의 ""삼촌""이 말을 타고있을 때처럼. 그들은 말을하고 이야기를하고 줄리는 갑자기 문장 중간에 질주했다. 나는 ""여기서 무슨 일이 있었나요?""와 같습니다 프랑스 경찰의 모든 장면은 한심합니다. 당신이 그를 정말로 필요로 할 때 Peter Sellers는 어디에 있습니까. 그 행동은 믿음 이상의 어리 석음입니다. 줄리와 그녀의 ""아저씨""가 그 열차에서 독일로가는 도중, 허드슨의 대대는 열차에서 총알을 쏘아 프로세스에서 릴리를 거의 죽였다. 훌륭한. 그 장면에서 재미있는 점은 한밤중에 기차에 2 번의 휴가가 있지만 허드슨과 그의 편대는 다음날 아침 비행기를 타더라도 열차에 도착한다는 것입니다. 저기 천천히 움직이는 기차입니다. <br /> <br /> 음악의 순간. 시작은 전체 영화의 가장 중요한 부분이며 (이 영화에 별 3 개를 주었던 이유) 효과는 끝에서 반복되기 때문에 상당히 줄어 듭니다. 중복에 대해 말하면, 우리는 실제로 캔 캔 댄스, Crepe Suzette 스트립 장면, Julie 스트립도보아야합니까? 피가 나고 있어도 ""남자가없는 땅의 소녀""는 괜찮지 만, 릴리가 프랑스 병원의 부상당한 병사들에게 노래를 부르기 때문에 그 순간 아무런 의미가 없습니다. 스파이의 결과로 간접적으로 부상을 당했습니까? <br /> <br /> 전체 프로젝트는 에너지가없고 무표정입니다. 로맨스는 100 % 믿을 수 없습니다. 록 허드슨은 너무 오래되고 피곤해 보입니다 (박물관 장면을 확인하십시오). Julie는 그녀가 Valium에있는 것처럼 황홀하게 보입니다. 그러나이 잘못된 프로젝트를 실제로 죽이는 것은 Julie가 독일 스파이를하는 것입니다. Edwards는 필사적으로 아내를 괴롭히는 Mary Poppins 증후군을 없애고 싶어했으며 배신자 역할을하는 것이 좋은 직업 결정이라고 믿었습니다. 줄리를 좋아하는만큼 그녀는 그레타 가르보가 아니에요. 줄리가 독일 스파이를한다고해도 재밌고 귀여운 모습을 보여줍니다. <br /> <br /> DARLING LILI는 얼마나 나쁜가요? Blake Edwards는 출시 된 지 37 년이 지난 후에도 DVD 출시를 위해 여전히 노력해야한다고 생각했습니다.","数年前、DARLING LILIがテレビで再生されたとき、それは常にパンとスキャンのバージョンでしたが、私はそれを嫌い、適切なワイドスクリーン形式でフィルムを見るのを待ちました。そのため、このジュリーアンドリュース/ブレイクエドワーズの作品の安価なDVDを見て、購入してすべての人に見てみることにしました。<br /> <br />少年、なんと恐ろしい映画でしょう。それは非常に悪いことであり、非常に多くのレベルで、どこでいつそれがひどく間違っているかを説明する際、どこから始めればよいのか本当にわかりません。今見てみると、他の非常に多くの監督がミュージカル（メリーポピンズ、サウンドオブミュージック、徹底的にモダンなミリーなど）でアンドリュースと金メダルを獲得したという理由だけで、ブレイクエドワーズが妻のためにこのスターの乗り物を作成したことは映画ファンには明らかですが、アンドリュースは、ハリウッドがセクシーでもグラマラスでもないと思ったために、ジュリー自身がステージで有名にしたプロジェクト（CAMELOT、MY FAIR LADYなど）で主演を控えていました。だからブレイクは、スパイストーリー/戦争映画/ロマンス/ドタバタ喜劇/ミュージカルの奇妙な調合で妻を紹介するために、この死ぬほどの努力を生み出しました。 DARLING LILIは複数の人格に悩まされており、誰であるか、またはそれが何であるかを知りません。いくつかの特定のシーンは良いまたは効果的ですが、全体として、それは非常に恥ずかしいほどにはまったく機能しません。<br /> <br />注意してください、DVDのバージョンは「ディレクターズカット」です""、またはこの場合は、この悪名高い興行フロップから""私たちができることは何でもサルベージしよう ""。エドワーズはDVDのリリース時に、オリジナルの肥大化した劇場版から19シーン（19 !!!!!!!!）をカットして、このより合理化された非効率的なバージョンに変更しました。映画は、それが何であるかを知らずに動きます。開始から25分ですが、何が起こっているのか、何が起こっているのかをなぜ見ているのか、まだわかりません。リリってどんなスパイ？彼女はどれほど強力ですか？彼女は誰かの死に責任がありましたか？代わりに、完全に退屈そうに見えるロック・ハドソンが完全に退屈そうに見えるジュリー・アンドリュースを引き寄せようとしているのを見ます。二人が恋に落ちる不可解な理由で物事はあまり助けられていません。ジュリーはなぜハドソンに陥るのですか？なぜ彼と彼女が関わった他の男性ではないのですか？彼女の元の誰かがぶらぶらして、彼女を取り戻そうとしているか、彼女の秘密を解読しようとしていたはずです。これは、混乱した行動とはかなり必要な対照を私たちに与えたでしょう。それはまた、停滞した手続きにいくらか勢いを与えていただろう。このストーリーには触媒はありません。<br /> <br />エドワーズと作家がアンドリュース（およびエドワーズ）の以前の成功に触発されたアイデアを思いついただけであることを明確に確認するには、カットシーンを確認するだけです。最良の（または最悪の）例は、AndrewsとHudsonが森の真ん中で歌う子供たちのグループを追うシーンです。エドワーズがサウンドオブミュージックをチャネリング。彼がDVDからそれを削除したのも不思議ではありません。 1970年に戻って、そのシーンは一定のレベルで機能したかもしれませんが、今日、その瞬間は絶望の悲鳴です。アンドリュース/エドワーズの他の映画から直接着想を得た他のプロット要素があります。ドッグファイトの無限のシーンは、はるかに優れたモダンミリーに触発されました。ジュリーのMARY POPPINSペルソナをからかうためだけに作曲された音楽の瞬間「私は3つの推測をお届けします」は、ジュリーが演技でストリップをしていることで「汚い」ものになります。ハドソンの飛行機に向かって走っているジュリーのエンディングの鳥瞰図は、SOUND OF MUSICのもう1つの「ウィンク」です。<br /> <br />全体が混乱しています。ジュリーは、イギリスに住むドイツ人の父親とイギリス人の母親から生まれた歌手を演じています。イギリス人はパリで彼女の（英語の）歌を歌っています。ストーリーがどこで発生するか正確にはわかりません。いくつかの瞬間はちょうどひどく編集されています。ジュリーと彼女の「叔父」が馬に乗っているときのように。彼らは話し、話し、それからジュリーは突然文章の途中で全力疾走します。私は「ここで何が起こったのか？」<br /> <br />お笑いのビットはおかしく、うんざりする価値があります。フランスの警察とのあらゆる場面は哀れです。あなたが本当に彼を必要とするとき、ピーター・セラーズはどこにいますか。アクションは信じられないほど愚かです。ジュリーと彼女の「叔父」がその列車でドイツに向かう途中、ハドソンの飛行隊は列車に弾丸を発射し、その過程でリリをほぼ殺害した。鮮やかさ。そのシーンで面白いのは、深夜に2つの列車が出発することですが、ハドソンと彼の戦隊は、翌朝飛行機で飛んでも列車に到着します。そこはゆっくり動く列車です。 <br /> <br />音楽の瞬間。最初は映画全体の最も良い部分です（そして私がこの映画に3つ星を与えた理由です）が、最後に繰り返されるため、効果はかなり減少します。冗長と言えば、カンカンダンス、クレープスゼットのストリッピングシーン、ジュリーのストリッピングも本当に見なければならないのでしょうか。 「無人の土地にいる少女」は、たとえ出血がはっきりしているとしても大丈夫ですが、リリがフランスの病院で負傷した兵士のグループに歌ったので、その瞬間はまったく意味がありません。彼女のスパイの結果により間接的に負傷しましたか？<br /> <br />プロジェクト全体は無力でエネルギーがありません。ロマンスは100％信じられないほどです。ロック・ハドソンは古すぎるし、見た目に疲れています（博物館のシーンをチェックしてください）。ジュリーは、彼女がバリウムにいるように、目がくらんでいるように見えます。しかし、この誤った構想のプロジェクトを本当に殺しているのは、ジュリーがドイツのスパイを演じていることです。エドワーズは妻を悩ませているメアリーポピンズ症候群を一掃することを必死に望んでおり、裏切り者を演じることは良いキャリア決定であると信じていました。ジュリーが好きなのと同じくらい、彼女はグレタガルボではなく、マタハリで美しく引き離しました。面白いことに、ジュリーがドイツのスパイを演じたとしても、彼女はまだ面白くてかわいいと出くわします。<br /> <br /> DARLING LILIはどれほど悪いですかリリースから37年経った今でも、ブレイクエドワーズはDVDリリースのために引き続き取り組む必要があると感じていました。"

"I want the 99-minute life wasted on this pathetic excuse for the movie. The acting was terrible! I was a fan of Cameron Diaz and Vincent D'Onofrio. I will never see them the same again. Keanu Reeves and Dan Aykroyd were not surprising. Everyone knows they can never act. Thankfully, only Dan tried to accent. His accent was a disaster as expected. I don't think I'm confused about the location of the movie or actually talked to anyone from Minnesota. I hope this review will help someone who hasn't decided what to do with this precious time. The only reason I can browse the whole movie is because I was stuck somewhere with nothing I could see or read.","I want to reclaim 99 minutes of my life wasted on this pathetic excuse of the movie.The acting was amazing!

"One of my favorite movies which has been overlooked by too many movie goers, an observation which mystifies me.Not only directed by the acclaimed Ang Lee,it had many young actors who were to become major stars, eg, Tobey Maguire (before Spiderman) , Skeet Ulrich (before Jericho), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (before Tudors), James Caviezel, Simon Baker, Mark Ruffalo, Jeffrey Wright, Tom Wilkinson, and Jewel. All of the acting was superb and each of the actors mentioned gave memorable performances, especially Meyers who portrayed an evil villain who killed for the sake of killing.<br /><br />When the biographies and accomplishments of the director (even when he won an academy award) and the actors are listed, this film is usually omitted from their past performances.I discovered the film on DVD by accident and it became one of my most often watched films.However, it is seldom every seen on cable .I look forward to reading what others suggest are the reasons this film is not well known.","One of my favorite movies that too many movie lovers overlook.There were many young actors who became major stars as well as the acclaimed director of Henry., Mark Ruffalo, Jeffrey Wright, Tom Wilkinson, and Jewel.

"It's nice to see a romantic comedy without a squeaky man lead. This acts solidly on both male and female leads, the story is a bit long and a bit cliché, but you can't help but I like it. <Br /> <br /> The end of the story was a little hurried, but if you extend it, the story will be longer. It is superior to other romantic comedies like Mr. Oman and 100 days and is probably connected with my teacher friend. <br /> <br /> It's not interesting for Korean girls, but it will give an interesting introduction to Korean films.","It's great to see a romantic comedy without the lead of a pretty man.It has solid acting from both male and female leads, and the story is a bit long and a bit cliché, but you don't like it, but you don' t.<br /> <br /> I think the story was in a hurry at the end, but extending it makes the story even longer.It is superior to other romantic comedies, such as 100 days with a arrogant Mr, and may also be tied to a tutor friend.<br /> <br /> This isn't as great as my cheeky girl, but it still introduces a good Korean movie..."
"Like all sentinels in the 70's, none of them imitated the nature of the war between good and evil. That's right. There are movies like Exorcist and other movies. But none of them caught the human element of the main character like this. Check this out if you have time. You can't miss a dated device, but this story is worth it. Then there are stars and soon stars. My favorites are Eli Wallach, Sylvia Miles and Burgess Meredith. Then there is a subtle clue as to what is going on. Concentrate. I had to look at it four times to catch up with all the little strange statements like'black and white cat, black and white cake'. Besides, the books are really good too.

"This seems to be the second remake of the film, filmed before 1911 and 1918. And in many ways it reminds me of the yak of the later film OXFORD. Both films are associated with a strong blow to the pride that arrived at one of the best schools in the world, and ultimately a slow learning blow to teamwork and dignity. In this movie, William Haines is ""Tom Brown"" and his main rival ""Bob"" is played by Frances X. Bushman. And the supporting role is Jack Pickford. Always remembered as Mary's brother. Of these three, Pickford gets the best as a compassionate loser who becomes Tom's friend. Actually there are some decent scenes as well as dramatic moments just before the big game! There are all standard cliche scenes, and the film has been performed many times before, so there is little surprise. However, it is a fun and good-looking movie. <br /> <br /> For the quietest college film, try Harold Lloyd's THE FRESHMAN. The football scene is honestly more interesting and Harold is much more exciting. It is more sympathetic than the annoying Tom Browne. FRESHMAN is probably the best university picture you can find in the times. The reason BROWN AT HARVARD is a smaller picture is because William Haines essentially repeated the same plot over and over again with the same plot. (Eg WESTPOINT and THE SMART SET, etc.) When you saw one of these movies, you saw all of them well made, but definitely. It is not original! And it's just a reorganization of his other films, so anyone who gives the movie 10 points is better to watch this other film. <br /> <br /> 4/25/08 == I just checked and tried. This little movie has been the highest rated movie in IMDb since 1920!! Talk about overestimating! There are dozens and dozens of better movies. Anyone can guess how this film won first place.","This is clearly the second remake of the film, previously filmed in 1911 and 1918.And in many ways, it reminds me of the later movie, A YANK AT OXFORD.

"Owen loves his Mamma... he liked her 6 feet more in this dark, dark and funny comedy with great support from Billy Crystal and Anne Ramsey, starred and directed by Danny DeVito. <br /> <br /> ""Throw your mother in the train"" is a great comedy, even if it's not a great movie. Partially too shallow and less organic than the ending. However, Crystal and DeVito take on the essence of a struggling writer, using great screen chemistry and using original cartoons. (DeVito is passionate but has no talent and Crystal is intercepted and written.) <br /> <br /> Professor Donner of Crystal thinks that his ex-wife unfortunately stole a book titled ""Hot Fire"" and the first line of the next book You cannot write more. He writes a novel by Tom Clancy, but teaches a unique budding writing class, including a middle-aged woman who doesn't know what a submarine captain is talking about.

Owen is a rather unusual character who lives in his late 30s with his mother, Anne Ramsey, and appears as the main character in the film. In another movie we'll feel sorry for Owen, but for the laughter of ""Throw your mom in the train"", stack up the brutality of life in this sad sack and expect us to follow. This is one of the big reasons why this movie probably loses a lot of people. <br /> <br /> For those of you who enjoy the character's humor, equate with him, and take the rest of what we see here, wait a minute, following the bigger bit comb this comedy has is a big deal. no. Owen asked to see entertainment while Professor Donner asked for help in planning to kill his mother. In fact, he first went to Hawaii and killed a man who was ex-donor's hate. Then, as you can see in Hitchcock's ""Stranger on the Train"", tell the professor that it is his turn to kill Mrs. Rift. <br /> <br /> As Director, DeVito not only complements the actor's performances with scene settings that accentuate the conversation, but also throws an unrealistic, unrealistic reality that anchors the audience to the toes by creating bold visual expressions (and so too). To avoid taking things seriously).) <br /> <br /> Also, the helper Stu Silver keeps the laughter with his quota patter. ""Here's a mouse the size of an Oldsmobiles."" ""She's not a woman. She's a terminator."" One little murder and I'm Jack the Ripper. ""These are all Crystal's words, but they work in context, but absolutely The most fun lines to kill are DeVito and Ramsey. According to the IMDb, Silver hasn't written any other scenarios since this time, and it's a shame because he's really talented. <br /> <br /> When Crystal met Ramsey, the best scenes from this movie were actually used The only time I saw the movie was promoted that way as a theatrical'coming attraction' presentation. Owen introduces'Cousin Patty' to his mother to the professor, and when Momma tells him that he has no Cousin Patty, the panic Owen loses it. 'You lied to me.' Screamed and pounded the professor's forehead. <br /> <br /> Of course, the professor doesn't actually moan something witty on the floor, but the'Throw Mom' Train' works effectively at that moment when the Looney Tunes vibe is unleashing its full value. Of course, DeVito hasn't disappeared from the movie, but it's a mystery that he didn't actually follow the film's director's promise.

Owen is a somewhat unusual person to star in the film.A boy in his late thirties and lives with his strong mother, Anramsey .

"Filmfour will have to do much better than this little film to get a reputation that suits him. <br /> <br /> This film was set in Glasgow, but the second assistant character has access to Scottish accents). The premise for people where life can't go anywhere is that they work at night and meet people in the same cafe early in the morning, making a really fun, insightful, quirky and quirky movie. Instead we have a conspiracy done against a group of apostles who were obsessed with themselves and beats that were not banned. X and Y are friends. X is sleeping with Z. Y is also sleeping with Z. Oh, I got it. <br /> <br /> Waste of time. Painful conversation-I think a 16-year-old group was writing for the GCSE drama project. The female character was completely unnecessary. It was written as a token woman, hoping that women could see it. <br /> <br /> A bully who can laugh at a beer advertisement is usually found wandering in packs shouting in the city center, not on Saturdays. Then you will like this movie and you will find ""right laff"". Others run, and don't get out of this sorry little misfit. <br /> <br /> One question is, when the group left the ""boring"" seaside town (the desert court changed its name in the movie, but by chance), to get back to Glasgow, why they were in Lancaster's Forton in England Did you do it through highway service?","Filmfour needs to be much better than this small group of movies to get the right reputation for themselves.<br /> <br /> The film is set in Glasgow (although some secondary characters have something that approaches the Scottish accent).It's possible to make really interesting, insightful, quirky, and tissue-friendly movies on the premise that no one alive will go anywhere and everyone will meet at the same cafe early in the morning when they work at night.It was.

"Dr. Mordrid is one of the rare films that is completely under the radar, but totally worth it. It really reminds me of old serial numbers in my 30s and 40s.

"It doesn't happen very often, but sometimes a person can make a big difference. <br /> <br /> George Crile's 2003 bestseller, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR, is an interesting and striking account. ""Good Time Charlie"", the cause of the relatively unclear House of Representatives of the Second District of Texas, an unimaginable ""difference maker"", was better known for his free lifestyle than his liberal legislation. Lufkin's great people wanted guns and two, so Charlie Wilson (even Charlie politician) is full of the beauty of Beltway, known as Charlie's Angels. <br /> <br /> When asked why the entire staff is attractive, his aide is classic in his reaction. Teach the type. However, you cannot teach them to increase their breasts. No matter how controversial, there is a conscience hidden beneath it, and Charlie Wilson has been humiliated by Afghanistan's unimaginable cruelty to exert political legitimacy about making money in exchange for him. It could help defeat the Russian army, and perhaps rush the end of the Cold War. Fat chance, huh? <br /> <br /> In the wise direction of Mike Nichols and Adam Sorkin's wise and cheerful scenario, the CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR is an elaborate satire. A colorful character composed of ""Charlie's Team"". <br /> <br /> ""Team"" on the screen is made up of 3 amazing actors with 4 Academy Awards and 9 Nominations. Charlie was beautifully portrayed by Tom Hanks in a sturdy, somewhat understated way, one of his best works for years. He remained calm and calm with the help of Joanne Herri ng, a wealthy Houston celebrity who was still played by the hottest Julia Roberts. Hey, why is there a bikini scene than telling the world this? Roberts looks good in all respects and retains her appearance, but the script is Kabul and the country based on her personality. It doesn't hint why it's important. Maybe the two Afghan Hounds next to her probably know-as an audience, we never do. Philip Seymour Hoffman, the third member of ""Team,"" is smart about every scene he appears in. Street (non-ivy league graduates) Marked as Gusta Aurakotos, the CIA's malicious content. In Wilson's bedroom. <br /> <br /> For Mujahideen to succeed, the most important aid the US can provide is its ability to shoot down the fearful MI-21 helicopter gunship that rules the sky. This requires money and a lot of money and eventually ""Charlie's team"" secretly forces people in Congress to fund a $1 billion coordination for advanced weapons to arm the Afghan rebels. These include cutting-edge state-of-the-art anti-aircraft and anti-tank rockets and other highly sophisticated killing devices. Unpleasant and unpleasant things. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how billions of dollars of illegal activity can and will happen behind the door of Congress. Every American should watch this movie or read this book. Because this book reveals the political scene of an ordinary business situation that we rarely see outside the walls of our government. The initial results of ""Mom"" and ""Tim Charlie"" were unsuccessful, but the unimaginable and unpredictable end result is that this sophisticated weapon is now in use. Against our troops by the Taliban and others. Since the fund was entirely ""secret"", young people in the region had no idea that the fall of Soviet oppression and the end of Russian barbarism were the direct result of US intervention. Yes, after Russkies left, our aid was provided, including a zipper for school, a zipper for infrastructure, and a zipper for maintaining meaningful relationships with Afghans. As a result, the overall outcome is an unmitigated disaster. This is like a pioneer in ""Achieving Missions."" <br /> <br /> As Nicole's movie pointed out, ""The ball you set is bouncing even after you lose interest.""

"I'm a big fan of surreal art, but Bunuel's film (with some ideas from Dali) made me cool. Bunuel had a lifelong grudge against the Catholic Church and was delighted to anger the Catholics in a fairly silly way. This is one of the most stupid people.

If that's the point, Bunuel expresses it in the most roundabout way possible. The central male character is an unpleasant beast who likes to chase dogs on the streets and knock out blind people and mentally turn billboard advertising into a strange sexual fantasy. Is this the fault of the church (has it interfered with love) or is it just a fool? I vote for the latter. I thought Bunuel should have had a lot of personal hangouts and chose Catholics to blame. <br /> <br /> The moment you cry, this ""Aha!

If you think it's superficial, the whole movie encapsulates those scenes. She kept saying how much she ""loved"" him and met him. Wear it thin and really fast. I couldn't laugh all over the movie. It is clear that she is using him as a meal ticket, but the director is immature enough to think that any love is actually happening. The disgusting scene was where two people had sex with the naked body, and it almost inspired the vomiting, so I had to get it cold.

So far all of this is correct. But they insist that if you believe you can walk the wall in good faith, you can actually do it. This is a complete poppy. Instead, the theory claims that at our level, it is possible for you to cross the wall, but it happened by chance and has nothing to do with faith. You will also have to keep walking to the wall for eternity to have the most distant opportunity to pass through the wall. Odds look astronomically too rough. <br /> <br /> This is how they misunderstand science. But the story related to the unfortunate photographer played by Marlee Maitlan is even more annoying.

"Chuck Jones' second seasoning of the most beloved hunting trilogy is often considered the best of the three. It's almost impossible to choose one of three fantastic cartoons, but you have to admit that'Rabbit Seasoning' is the most elaborately polished script. Here, Bug and Daffy focus on language through a series of complex conversations in Abbot and Costello's'Who's on next' routine of the routine of Lutin. As a long-term Daffy fan, I've always been delighted with the hunting trilogy because I'm Daffy who always gets the best line (all the famous classic pronouns ""pronoun problems""). As always, the bug acts as a nice manipulator while being bullied. Part of what makes the hunting trilogy so much fun is that Daffy and Elmer pose so little threat to the bug that they basically kick and easily laugh. Elmer is a poor old Daffy who falls into all the traps set for him, but shot the worst face and bumps it again. It is all based on the inevitable climax declaration ""You're despicable"".

That's good, and I should have known this","I commented on this when it first debuted and gave it a ""middle thumb"" review, saying that I want to give me suspicious profits as well as the first episode. By this time in June 2006, we had seen a total of 6 episodes. And as a lifelong Batman fanatic, I can say without hesitation: This show is totally silly. <br /> <br /> Everything is wrong. all. Beyond the poor animation and design, the story becomes tremendously complex and there is no character development or obvious interest by the author of this drek to give substance to the story. <br /> <br /> And for God. .. Is it just me or the Joker of all episodes? Is Gotham much of a revolving door justice system? Or, again, to focus on other villains is a complete lack of writer interest (see ""No Character Development"" above). <br /> <br /> And, worse, all Joker stories are the same three-part formula. <br /> <br /> 1) The Joker blows gas on people. <br /> <br /> 2) The Joker blows gas across the city. <br /> <br /> 3) Batman saves the day. <br /> <br /> Pfeh. <br /> <br /> There was one episode that was not a Joker story. The title escapes me, but the villain was the evil crewmaster... ""Think Thank Thunk"" episode of the quiz show. It was the worst Batman story I've ever seen, heard or read. Yes, it's worse than ""I got Batman in the basement"". <br /> <br /> I can't really say how I feel about this show, as this show is probably against ToS, but it starts with ""B"" and rhymes with ""fastardization"" ..

"Just because someone is under 10 doesn't mean it's stupid. If your child likes this movie, it is better to take a test. I continued to be surprised that so many people could be involved in things that seemed so bad. This ""movie"" is a showcase for digital wizards. The writing is terrible. I can't remember when I hear such a bad conversation. The song is miserable. Acting is low-level, but not much was given to the actor. Who decided to hire Joey Fatone?

"What can you say about the White Fire movie? Remarkable? Is it fantastic? Hindrance? Is it fun? This word is not big enough to describe the White Fire event. Shaky, from the beginning to the profound end, this film will delight you all over the world. <br /> <br /> Our movie begins in the forest somewhere in the world. Families are hiding from soldiers who are not wearing uniforms in costume shop uniforms. When a father breaks up with his mother and children, he actually knows what kind of movie he is trying to watch. Father wears white clothes and rolls down the hill and acts politely if he draws people's attention before shooting them, but unfortunately, Dad is burned alive like an unsupervised and unsafe stunt. Meanwhile, mother and children run about 5 feet behind the beach with armed soldiers. He also had the bizarre ""HALT!"" Strict warning before acting in the form of wasting mother immediately. This action sequence sets the happy childhood of the heroes Bo and Ingred. <br /> <br /> Now we're fast going around 20 years (30 if we are honest at the age of the hero) with a beautiful Turkey with Bo. Ingred settled as a professional thief or diamond prospect. Ingred works in a diamond mine to help him find things, while Bo (the protagonist played by dynamic Robert Ginty) roams the desert in a denim outfit. Bo and Ingrid have an interesting relationship. They seem to have no other friends and spend all their time together. ""You think you're ashamed,"" to make a dynamic duo while Bo knows he's his sister. With the testimony saying ""I wanted to sleep with my brother,"" I was accompanied by the fact that I expressed my wish. Vogue is built around the beaches of Turkey with scarves of ridiculous pink sorrow when Ingrid was killed. A renewal of hope arises when Bo discovers a woman who looks like Ingrid and undergoes plastic surgery to make her look exactly like Ingrid. This opens the door for Bo to have sex with his sister without being technically wrong. Bo is a fan who loves ethical gray areas and is delighted with new love. <br /> <br /> Anyway, fun action scenes, ridiculous violence, great acting, it's impossible to follow the plot, Fred ""The Hammer"" Williamson (for any reason), and a giant diamond (which will explode later) Dirty ice cube. All of this is great, but the relationship between Bo and Ingrid makes this movie special.... really special. So I see the majesty that is flame for everyone. You may not be pleased with you.","What do you think about the movie ""White Fire""? Great? Great? Is it a hindrance? Hilarious, hilarious?

Coupled with the fact that Bo expressed a desire to sleep with her sister, he proved to her while she was naked, such as the line ""You're sorry to be my sister"" As you can see, it creates a very dynamic duo.

"I am so disappointed.This movie left me feeling jipped out of my time and mental energy.Here was the quintessential Woody Allen film all over again: the neurotic upper-class Manhattanites debating whether or not they will cheat on their spouses.

"This film is ultra-light fluff and can be predicted from start to finish. As a Don Knotts vehicle, ""The Incredible Mr. Limpet"" was much better and the Knott's traits were incompetent or ignorant. His performance deteriorated with his invisible gaze staring, but it could be related to replacing most movies with cartoon fish. Knotts, like Bob Denver, played a desirable displeasure. It seemed that both could not be divided into different types of roles, assuming they were simply type casts. Probably because of a stupid, rough stare, high-pitched voice. John Ritter, with whom Knotts worked for ""Three's Company"", was able to successfully diverge beyond the genre into dramatic roles such as ""Oz Dreamer of Oz"", but the nearest Knotts played a small role in ""Pleasantville"". Even Leslie Nielsen was not a dramatic actor at the time, or a deadpan comedy actor who later became a ""airplane."" And ""Police Squad."" <br /> <br /> At the time, the 43-year-old Knotts, at the age of 35, had no way to pass through, as his character claimed. It was ridiculously unbelievable, as 38-year-old Tom Hanks played Forrest Gump in college. This is particularly evident in the ""outside"" scene of ""town"" after Roy was fired. Even preschoolers are unlikely to be fooled by soundstage satellites like Mayberry. <br /> <br /> This is very frustrating even though it's as strict as a children's movie. Not because there is no action or special effect. The situation is repeated because it is too slow. How many times can I see Roy on the bus? Comedy for kids should be a crazy cap, sometimes with a malicious gag. Otherwise, the children are boring high ranks (even all adults in the theater). Even for children's films, films have improved considerably over the decades. Even many modern comedies are better written and written. Disney's ""Worms of Love"", for example, had at least an interesting race action.","All of this movie is superlight fluff that is predictable from start to finish.As a vehicle for Don The Knotts, ""The Incredible Mr. Limpet"" was far superior, and Knott's personality was not as incompetent or ignorant.

"If you want to learn more about this kind of thing happening in modern civilization, there are excellent books called ""The Outlaw Sea"" or ""The Outlaw Sea"". Pollution illegality is a reality for many reasons. However, many cargo ships in the world have suspicious registrations (nationalities), and it is impossible to enforce international law when ship owners do not have offices in actual countries. Second, many ship lines employ crews from heavily polluted third world countries. Crew members are often threatened and harassed to comply with suspicious or illegal practices (such as illegal immigrant workers). Third, there are often language barriers not only between executives and crew members, but also between crew members. The crew is rewarded for compliance and silence. Fourth, after committing illegal acts once, the ship can hide inconspicuously with little use of fresh paint coat. Anyway, it is a fascinating reading. <br /> <br /> Interesting stories, great movies. Does anyone know how HBO makes the best movies? Hollywood has a hard time releasing Oscar-worthy movies every year, and some of the top five competitors are from the UK.

"In all honesty, I haven't seen this movie for years, but many times I tend to memorize some of it, as anyone who saw it could understand. I first saw it as a young kid at the YMCA Halloween party in the early 60's and scared the hell out of the kids in a fun way. I remember feeling a real anxiety about the unknown in the maze. I have no risk of giving an ending, except that I am surprised. I vaguely remember that the entire audience of the little boys let go of the terrified Horror, and then laughed when a terrible secret was revealed. Most viewers saw the ending as one of the most unintended and funniest climaxes for movies in film history, but it moved in a strange way. It's not easy these days. I don't know if it can be used in home videos, but it still provides great Halloween features for both kids and adults.","To be honest, I haven't seen this movie for years, but some times it tends to be part of my memory, so that anyone who sees it can understand.I saw it for the first time as a kid at the YMCA Halloween party in the early 60s and scared children's hell in a fun way.I was really worried about the unknown in the maze.

"You may think that the premise of the movie is enjoying a serious journey when traveling mainly between Italy, Bulgaria, Croatia and Slovenia, traveling around 3000 miles from France to Saudi Arabia, before arriving in Turkey and the Middle East. . However, this is not a trip, and there is no waypoint to soak in the sight. <br /> <br /> Reda's father is in his twilight year and wants to do Haj.

Face, strange people they meet, remove it in various weather conditions, take turns relaxing in the motel and sleeping in the car. We know there is a distinct generational gap between a father trying to communicate with one another, a son trying to force a son, and a son trying to claim himself as an adult, but we can see that in this situation, Reda is a fish coming out of the water. There is. Through many meetings they actually team very well despite their differences. <br /> <br /> It's probably quite a while with other Haj pilgrims that this movie was released last week to match Hari Raya Haji and have the opportunity to see our protagonist.

Even after 60 years, it's still fun. This animated short was 똈","The great Bugs Bunny cartoon of the past has Bugs as a performer on the window display of a local department store. After he has finished his work for the day, the manager comes to talk to him that he will be transferred soon. Bug gladly makes him think that his new job is stuffing... and that stuffing has something to do with animal fillings. Animals say a specific rabbit. This causes a wit battle between the notorious Rabbit and his former employer. I found these shorts to be fun and definitely one of the better in the early 1940s. It still remains interesting over 60 years later. This animated short can be seen on Disc 1 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Volume 2. <br /> <br /> My grade: A-"
"I think the best Oscar awards in recent years have been firmly believed for two reasons in 2003. <br /> <br /> 1) Steve Martin was the most witty person. Limo ""And"" my bed. It's better not to mention the gay mafia when waking up with a poodle head at ""<br /> <br /> 2) Amazing winner: Nobody beats Adrian Brody for the best actor (genuine applause)) Or Roman Polanski's best director (genuine jeers and boos) won, but last year's awards ceremony wasn't that bad, but there were few surprises, and I was delighted to see the return. (FELLOWSHIP is much better) What stopped BBC broadcasts was Jonathan Ross getting some of his sycophantic colleagues and pretending to be funny when they were doing something, but... so I heard that Sky was reporting on British TV. When Barry Norman and Mark Kermode expected to follow the link, they did with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne instead, but it would be foolish if British TV is desperate for film critics. Willing to fly to LA to give honest opinions.<br /> <br /> Chris Rock wasn't that bad, but the location wasn't Steve Steve as it resembled a sports hall with seats! There aren't so many stadiums, the main problem I had with the ceremony was the ""minor"" Oscar handing over to the winner who sat down! There's no such thing as a ""little"" Oscar, and the award won the Best Animated Short or Best Costume Design award. It's worth as much as Be St Picture or Best Director. You must be able to march. How arrogant the academy is, I agree with the opinion that this form could be the worst ceremony in history, if not infamous and surprising. Awards . <br /> <br /> Best Supporting Actress-Cate Blanchett <br /> <br /> Best Supporting Actor-Morgan Freeman Freeman is one of the largest living character actors in the United States, so real dissatisfaction. There is no <br /> <br /> Best Actress -Jamie Foxx The most predictable yawn of the night <br /> <br /> Best Actress -. Hilary's nk all had great surprises since they thought Annette Benning would simply win the academy politics, but Swank was worth it and gave the best speech at night. A big surprise since everyone thought Scorsese would win an award because it has never been. In fact, if you are not suitable for TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS, it is because you did not qualify for AVIATOR <b /> <br /> Best Film-MILLION DOLLAR BABY. Another big surprise, because everyone thought the academy would split the awards for the best directors and best photos, but AVIATOR's Hollywood-friendly plot will be the subject of much of the MDB's debate. Voter Off <br /> <br /> What you see at the awards ceremony is this year's voters have decided to ignore Oscar politics and truly reward those who deserve what they haven't done in the past. Beautiful heart hitting the expedition of the ring for glamor! And for a long time, the academy would vote","<br /> <br /> 1) Host Steve Martin was the most resourceful: ""The limousine I saw the team stars putting Michael Moore in the trunk"" and ""Poodle's head woke up in bed."" It's better not to mention the gay mafia when it comes down to it.""<br /> <br /> 2) Surprising winner: Everyone is the best actor (true applause) or the best director Roman Polanski (a real joke).<br /> <br / > Last year's award ceremony wasn't too bad, but there were few surprises and I was happy to see RETURN OF THE KING is a trilogy.Get rid of the awards, if not the best (FELLOWSHIP was much better).But.When I heard that Sky was covering British TV, I was expecting Barry Norman and Mark Carmode to link, but ended up with Jamie Axton and Sharon Osbourne instead! It would be nice if British television was desperate for film critics (obviously they are) that both Bob The Mu and Theo Robertson would fly to LA and give honest opinions about winners and losers I'm sure<br /> <br /> Chris Rock wasn't too bad, but the pla Ce looked like a seated sports hall, but he's not Steve Martin! In my opinion, it's not a flashy arena. The main problem I had with the ceremony was the ""minors"" Oscars being distributed to the seated winners! There is no such thing as a ""minor"" Oscar, and is worthy of a Best Picture or Best Director just because an award wins Best Animation Shorts or Best Costume Design. All winners should be allowed to reach the podium.I completely agree with the comments that the academy is becoming arrogant, the format is shameful, and without surprise it could have been the worst ceremony in history.For the award itself,<br /> <br /> Best Supporting Actress-Cate Blanchett.There is no big surprise in the competitive division .<br /> <br /> The best supporting actor-Morgan Freeman. Freeman is one of America's greatest living actors, so there is no real complaint.<br /> <br /> Best actor-Jamie Foxx. The most predictable awards of the night. Yawn<br /> <br /> Best Actress-Hilary Swank. It was a big surprise as everyone thought that Annette Bening was simply going to win the politics of the academy, but Swank deserved it and made the best nightly speech<br /> <br /> Best Director- Clint Eastwood.It was a big surprise because everyone thought that Scorsese was trying to win the prize just because Scorsese had never won it.This is actually nice because he didn't deserve the Aviator Best Film-Million Dollar Baby if he didn't deserve the taxi driver, Lagging Bull and Goode Fellas< br /><br />. Another big surprise, where everyone thought the academy would split the awards for best director and best photo. Voter Voting<br /> <br /> These awards probably show that this year's succeed truly award those who ignore Oscar politics and deserve nothing that they have never done before.I decided to give it, that is, beat the ring fellowship for A Beautiful Mindgod! And for a long time, the academy will vote with their head instead of their heart"

"This should be the worst movie I have ever seen Nielson. This movie has nothing to do with him being fun. I think it's because movies like Naked Gun didn't have to make Nielson laugh. He played the role as straight as possible while all the comedies we just went through were mostly visual. But when you put him in a funny movie, he doesn't. There was one good part in the movie, some could be considered spoilers, and the starting point was an animation. It might be nice if the whole movie is animated.

"I like ghost stories. The lumpy story of the night, the unexplained voice. Now I have seen many of them. As the special efx becomes more and more interested in movies today to find real movies, writers and directors have to turn their clocks back to the time they really had to use their heads to create ghost stories. The very rare pilot episode called ""The New House"" from the TV series Ghost Story was one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Once in 1972... I was only nine years old, but nothing has been there ever since. During all the remakes in Hollywood, some have to do this ""as is"" without any special efx than the original. This episode was terrible like hell. I finally found it on DVD today and I am very rare and lucky to find it. Another two Ghost Stories are also nearby. It was ORIGINAL ""The Haunting"" of ""The Changling"" and George C. Scott. I hope someone can tell you more about this ghost story.","I like ghost stories.A ghost story with a good bump at night, an unexplainable voice.

"OK, I've watched this movie twice now, I've done a lot of research on the internet, and I have asked several people to comment there. It took me a while to read the original Sheridan Lafanu Classic'Carmilla', the book upon which the film was based. The best way to review this movie is by watching the game and explaining the game. Here's the plot of the book, as the plot of the movie doesn't make any sense. <br /> <br /> Laura and her father, De Lafontaine, live in Hanseong, Siberia. They continue their lives happily and peacefully. One day they receive a letter from'general' that made a life mission to avenge her daughter's death. He claimed that the supernatural power was working and explained that he would visit soon. Meanwhile, due to an accidental encounter with a strange woman, La Fontaine cared for her daughter Carmilla for several months. Soon Laura begins to be overwhelmed by strange dreams and begins to get sick. Who is this mysterious camilla? And how does she relate to Laura's condition, general? <br /> <br /> I invented this game and I want as many people as possible to play it. Please tell me the result. I even have a striking name and a jingle, but I can't bother with it. It's called ""This movie doesn't make sense"". <br /> <br /> Watch a movie and create a complete plot that explains what's going on. I mean complete, answer all questions, everything is meaningful, absolutely complete. <br /> <br /> You will have to answer the same question... <br /> <br /> * Why can a vampire walk all day long? light? <br /> <br /> * Why are they all lesbians? <br /> <br /> * Why is the woman called Bob? And why does she shoot herself? <br /> <br /> * When is the movie a dream and when is it real? <br /> <br /> * Why does killing a zombie seem like an acceptable part of life? <br /> <br /> * Why does Travis Fontaine find and run zombies without slowing down while driving a car? Do you accept her car, the excuse that she is a zombie? <br /> <br /> * And why did he publicly reveal that the girl had a head vampire and took him out of his car? <br /> <br /> * And would you like to drive alone with your daughter in a stolen car? <br /> <br /> What is going on in a mental hospital? <br /> <br /> * What is the green sticky thing about? <br /> <br /> * Why does the head vampire suddenly start to dress like a nurse? <br /> <br /> * Why aren't vampires fighting? zombie? <br /> <br /> * What does the necklace mean? What is it made of? Why kill vampires? And how does Jenna know it? <br /> <br /> Actually, it's fun to ask a lot of questions about this movie. <br /> <br /> There is my conspiracy <br /> <br /> In conclusion <br /> <br />'Vampires vs. Zombies' has no moment. It's actually a vampire fighting zombies. Everyone in the movie seems to know exactly what's going on, but the audience hates talking about it. And somehow it is based on classic 19th century horror novels. how? Why? What's going on?","Well, I have seen this movie twice now. I did some research online. So I asked some people for their opinions. I've read the original Sheridan Rafanu Classic ""Carmilla"", the book on which the movie was based. I think the best way to review this movie is to explain the game you play while watching it. This is a book scenario, as the movie scenario doesn't seem to make sense at all. <br /> <br /> Laura lives in a Siberian castle with her father, De La Fontaine. They continue their lives happily and peacefully. One day they receive a letter from a ""general"" from a man whose mission is to avenge the death of his daughter.

There are catchy names and jingles, but I don't care. It's called a ""this movie doesn't make sense"" game. <br /> <br /> All you have to do is watch the movie and come up with a complete plot that explains what's going on. That means it answers all questions, understands all meanings, and is completely complete. <br /> <br /> You need to answer questions such as the following... <br /> <br /> * Why can vampires roam all day long, Wright? <br /> <br /> * Why are you all lesbians? <br /> <br /> * Why is there a girl named Bob?

"This would have been a *great* quiet movie. Acting is really good, at least in Look Ma. I'm acting really big! <br /> <br /> Everything is huge. All lines are PROFOUND! All scenes are started by HUMAN TRAGEDY! However, as with any train accident, I could not take my eyes off. This conversation is without a doubt, but it would have worked on stage. On the screen, it's cluttered, colossal, hacky, and can use any other stereotyped adjective to depict really bad dramatic work. <br /> <br /> You can also enjoy a movie by stacking a lot of melodrama. But be prepared to wait. For all this melodrama, this thing definitely worked at his own pace. <br /> <br /> This script sounded a lot different when related actors read it themselves.

Or at least check the mute status. Perhaps you'll get some pleasure from all the arm sounds of the character. <br /> <br /> Ah, the wise words-To prove that this is really an artistic film, James Woods said to his stupid man, ""Look at me, I'm naked, too vulnerable-man's fantasy and character expression"".

"... This movie is played in two sequences, with the protagonist lying in a coma in the hospital ward. The unconscious protagonist sounds voiced by saying that it is an orderly shop. orderlies kiss I saw this in a DVD version and I suspected it would be fun-DVD I said ""comedy"" in the case, and it went that way. I heard some of the audience howling with laughter because it was fun and I had to sit in a comedy. It's exciting to think about what's fun and what's not, but this film unfortunately conveys only controversy. People like Ernst Lou Beach, Billy Wilder or Mel Brooks have proved that, but I think you should know ""mechanics"". Director and co-writer Dani Levy doesn't care about the mechanics and thinks certain things are simply fun. Don't take me wrong, some people can make it fun, Dani Levy can't do it for me, for me. Behind the main character's actions. I couldn't understand why the two orthodox Jewish brothers from West Germany dislike each other's three-star carbon copy of Fast Eddie Felson from former East Germany. Both are rather unique characters. Their children are bored with the fact that they are attracted to each other sexually. (Now, I'm a lesbian now, but she's raising a cousin and daughter) But this incest relationship -. Even if it's embarrassing -.. The scriptwriter comes as an excuse because he can't make a better one.<br /> <br /> The acting is not bad Udo Semel Even though he was a former secretary Helmut Cole (lighter version) ), but quite a lot. The direction itself isn't really bad either, but Levy has to stick to the film production and leave the script to others. Now he heard a comedy about Hitler Cucumber bye!","The movie begins where the coma protagonist in the ward begins with the order of the two. The disorderly protagonist is dubbed, saying he is homosexual. Kiss of order. I saw this on the DVD version and I suspect this should be strange. It's called ""comedy"" in the DVD case, and that's how it ends up. If you saw this in a movie theater, it was probably very funny, and you should be sitting in a comedy, so some of the audience heard a roaring roar. It's tempting to think about what's funny and what's not, but this movie unfortunately only offers discussion.<br /> <br /> Brilliant brains can make anything interesting. People such as Ernstruvic, Billy Wilder and Melbrooks proved that fact. Director and co-writer Dani Levy doesn't care about these mechanics. For example, I find the fact that the two orders homosexual and kissing a comatose man just to be interesting. Don't get me wrong, some people can make it crazy, Dani Levy can't, for me anyway. <br /> <br /> The main problem I have with this movie is that I don't see the reason behind the main character's actions. I couldn't understand why the two Orthodox Jews from West Germany were so disliked from each other about one-third carbon copies of Fast Eddie Felson from former East Germany. Both are rather mediocre personalities. Their children are boring apart from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other (well, one is now a lesbian, but is raising her cousin's daughter). But even these incestuous relationships, even if embarrassing, were an excuse because the screenwriter couldn't come up with a better one. <br /> <br /> Acting well, Udsemer reminded me of the former Prime Minister Helmut Kohl (a lighter version) than the old Orthodox Jews, but reminds me a lot more. It was. The direction itself isn't too bad, but Levy should focus on directing the film and leaving the script to someone else. Now I heard that he did a comedy about Hitler. Hey, Vai!"
"This story about the three women is a very sensitive study: The youngest of the 37-year-old Muriël (Charlotte Van Den Eynde), the oldest Martha (Frieda Pittors), the mother of Muriël. They live together in the same building. They have different expectations for life. Important Laura wants a child. Muriël is from the village and wants to change his life in Brussels. Martha dreams of being young in her childhood. Nothing really happens in this movie, so something that can polarize this story. Waiting (for example, an accident) Over time, director Dorothée Van Den Berghe has learned that he only wants to develop a psychological portrait of three women. I am disappointed because I do. So one remains empty.","This story about three women is a very sensitive study of: Muriël (Charlotte Van Den Eynde) is the youngest, Laura (Els Dottermans) is 37 years old, and Martha (Frieda Pittors) is the oldest Muriël's mother.

"Most of all, I liked Ray Bradbury's novel. It's the kind of fear that goes under your skin and sticks with you later. Along with Fahrenheit 451 and dandelion wine, it was one of his best books. I hope this movie goes well. There were many opportunities with great casts like Jason Robards and Jonathn Pryce. Bradbury also wrote the script himself. And above all, there is PAM GRIER! <br /> <br /> How can I fail? <br /> <br /> There may be a spoiler. <br /> <br /> First, it became silly. Many fears from this book have disappeared because Bradbury had to keep violence to a minimum. All the videos in this book are gone. Everything that messes you up is gone. <br /> <br /> And there is smoke. Like many of Disney's 80s films, the children of this film cannot act. And this has caused me a lot of problems. There were no 13, 9 or 10 of them. Their strong friendships were not covered. I think they know. <br /> <br /> Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce think Halloway and Dark can solve this. But it doesn't matter here. What they want to do is somehow pay the mortgage or something else. This is far from the best performance. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier was fine as a witch, but Dust Witch's character didn't work out. She is much less evil and does not exist as in the book. <br /> <br /> And everything missing from the book. Ballon Knight Chase, Jim's House Sign, Dark's True Death, What Happened to Mr. Kugan on the Carousel, Lightning Rod's Fate, Witch's True Death, and Oh much more. <br /> <br /> Even in the 80s, special effects were bad. The carousel of fate for the overlapping horses to turn is actually a creepy, strange green mist that actually has nothing to do with it. <Br /> <br /> I can still see how this movie tore the original novel, but it's bleeding. Do not watch this movie, read the book. Bradbury's classic.","First and foremost, I loved Ray Bradbury's novels. It's a kind of fear that gets under your skin and sticks with you later. This is one of his finest books, including 451 Fahrenheit and Dandelion wines. I hope this movie is ok. We had many opportunities with great casts like Jason Robards and Jonathn Pryce. Bradbury wrote the script himself. And in addition to that, there is PAM GRIER! <br /> <br /> Why do you fail? <br /> <br /> There may be a spoiler inside. <br /> <br /> First of all, it was ridiculous. Much of the horror from the book has been lost, as Bradbury must have been forced to minimize violence. All the visuals in the book... gone. Everything that rocked you... disappeared. <br /> <br /> And there is acting. The children of this movie can't act like many movies Disney abandoned in the 80s. And this bothered me a lot, neither of them looked like a 9 or 10 instead of 13. Their strong friendship was not treated. They were like acquaintances. <br /> <br /> I think Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce can separate this in the roles of Mr. Holloway and Mr. Dark. But here they don't seem to care. What they want to do is pay off some form of mortgage or something. This is far from being part of their best performance. <br /> <br /> Pamglia was fine as a witch, but Dustwich's own character wasn't well separated. She is much less evil than a book and has no presence. <br /> <br /> And everything left from the book. Balloon night chase, Jim's house sign, Mr. Dark's real death, what happened to Mr. Kogan in the merry-go-round, the fate of the Lightning Salesman, the witch's real death, and much more. <br /> <br /> And even in the 80s, the special effects were bad. The fateful round of fate of stacked horses was actually a weird, strange green fog that had nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> I could continue on how this movie broke the original novel, but it brings blood to the boil. Please read the book without watching this movie. It's a Bradbury classic."
"The film was so old that I didn't realize what it looked like in 1936 to look younger Ray Millland. I remember that he played in the great movie ""Lost Weekend"". Ray plays the role of Michael Stuart, a very wealthy banker. In this photo, there are three girls who aren't very happy about the separation of their father and mother, and they realize that their father will marry a gold-digging young blonde looking for a rich sugar dad. They hire a man to pose as a very wealthy count, his name is Count Ariszted (Misha Auer), she is not drunk and penniless and gives a lot of cartoon laughter throughout the picture. Deanna Durbin (Penny Craig) surprised everyone when booked at the police station, and after telling the police chief she was an opera star, Penny starts singing with the most fantastic soprano voice I've ever heard. The prisoners began to applaud. It was a very enjoyable and enjoyable scene in this movie. With Deanna Durbin's first film debut, she had an instant success overnight, and after leaving MGM, she became a great movie star with Universal Studios.","This movie is too old and I didn't notice how Reimiland looked young in 1936.

"I had eagerly awaited the first screening of this film ever since it was given to me on DVD at Christmas. Having reserved a special slot for it last night, I sat down to watch it with my daughter (aged 17 and a Film Studies student), with chocolates of course, in eager anticipation. We love Jane Austin.<br /><br />After just the first two minutes we knew we were sunk. The shaky camera shots and angles, general poor cinematography, direction and wooden performances. had already left us feeling flat and dissatisfied.Despondent, we viewed on.<br /><br />Anne, played by Sally Hawkins, looked oddly and with no particular purpose, directly at the camera on several occasions, breaking our hard- won'fantasy of the moment' and engaging us directly in an almost'I'll find you' stalking fashion.<br /><br />Poor Rupert Penry-Jones, who played Captain Wentworth, did his best with the script and direction, bless him.I hope they paid him well, however, as he was practically drowned on one occasion b ya huge wave which predictably breached the seawall, drenching him and his co-actor. They were nearly swept out to sea. Health and Safety would have had a field day! Poor Rupert was left spitting out sea water in order to deliver his line. Presumably there was not enough money left in the kitty for a re-shoot of this scene.Any one with any sense would have not attempted it on such a day in the first place.<br /><br />Other than Mr. Penry -Jones, Alice Krige gave the only convincing performance as Lady Russell but her efforts were soon counterbalanced by those of Anthony Head's unconvincing portrayal of annoying Sir Walter Elliott.<br /><br />Towards the long-awaited end of the film , Captain Wentworth appeared to oddly grace Anne with a visit every two seconds having taken great pains to avoid her for the majority of the movie.It was as if he had developed a memory impediment which caused him to forget his very reason for being.In contrast, Anne ran, hyper-ventilating, from pillar to post in search of the good Captain who, in the meantime, had managed to call upon almost the entire of Bath we are told, in the course of only three or four minutes, without even having worked up a sweat.<br />< br />We experienced none of Anne's charms crossing the screen. Indeed, we were left wondering what charismatic Captain Wentworth had ever seen in plain, spineless, opinion-less Anne and why someone, anyone, did not tell mean, winging Sir Walter to just shut the heck up.<br /><br / >The crucial kiss, normally our favorite girlie moment, was painfully drawn out.As they moved in closer, Anne kept opening and closing her mouth which had the effect on screen of making her look as if she were chewing gum before lips finally met. Eww! <br /><br />The most enjoyable thing about last night was the chocolates and the half hour exchange of views between mother and daughter on just how bad the film had been.<br /><br />What a pity to ruin such an enchanting and engaging story, filmed in some of England's finest scenery.<br /><br />Sorry Jane.","I've been waiting for the film to show it since it was handed over on DVD at Christmas. I booked a special slot last night, so I was looking forward to chocolate with my daughter (17 and movie research student), of course.

The shaky camera shots and angles, the general meager cinematography, direction and wooden performances were already flat and frustrating. <br /> <br /> Anne, played by Sally Hawkins, looks weird without any special purpose, and directly looks at the camera in some scenes, destroying and fascinating Hardwon's ""Fantasy of the Moments"" .. Almost'I'll find your stalking fashion. <br /> <br /> Poor Rupert Penley Jones, who played Captain Wentworth, did his best to screenplay and direct and celebrate. But I hope they paid him well because he actually drowned once by a huge wave that broke through the breakwater as he would have expected him and his co-stars to be drenched. They were almost washed away by the sea. Health and safety would have been a day of battle! Poor Rupert was left spit out seawater to deliver his line. Perhaps the kitten did not have enough money left to reshoot this scene. <br /> <br /> Except for Penley Jones, Alice Krighe had the only compelling performance of Mrs. Russell, but her efforts were soon offset by Anthony Head's annoying Walter. It is due to the unconvincing portrayal of Sir Elliott. <br /> <br /> Toward the end of the movie's long-awaited, Captain Wentworth seemed to make Anne look strange and elegant. Most of the movies are her. It was as if he had a memory problem. In contrast, Anne ran overventiled from post to post, looking for a good captain who, for a while, could call almost the entire berth we heard in just 3-4 minutes. It was. I didn't even sweat. <br /> <br /> There was no attraction for Anne across the screen. Sure, Captain Wentworth and the charismatic captain he has ever seen in plain, spineless, opinionless Anne, and anyone or anyone, doesn't say sneaky, it just silences Lord Walter. that's what I thought. <br /> <br /> An important kiss, usually our favorite girly moment, was painfully drawn. As they approached, Anne continued to open and close their mouth, affecting the screen as if their lips were chewing on gum before finally meeting. Eh ww! <br /> <br /> What I enjoyed last night was a 30-minute conversation between my mother and daughter about chocolate and how bad the movie was. <br /> <br /> Ruin such a captivating and fascinating story taken in some of Britain's best landscapes. <br /> <br /> Sorry Jane."

"This is an adaptation to Dan Brown's breathing book. I can't say it is novel or very good, but they made a movie for you to enjoy. Given a great story, the results may be better. The movie is quite long, but in the end it felt like something was missing. The sound effects and soundtrack were very good. Acting was good, but the character development stage was very weak. Things can look too fast for those who haven't read. From my point of view, they were able to try important scenes more appropriately, rather than trying to write as much as an object in a book. What makes this book so good is that all puzzles, like stories, are combined with a great portrait of the Vatican. You can't see it in the movie. Too rushing and not using time in a good way is a major problem with the movie. So it's worth seeing, but it might have done better.","This is an OK adaptation of Dan Brown's breathtaking book.I can't say that it's new and good, but the movie is finished.If you had a great story, the results might have been better.The movie is quite long, but in The end it felt like something was missing.The sound effects and the soundtrack were very good.The performance was good, but the character development phase was very weak.To those who haven't read the book, things may seem to happen too soon From my point of view, instead of trying to put as much as possible from the book, they could have tried to make the important scenes more relevant.What made this book so good were all the puzzle-like stories combined with the stunning portrait of the Vatican.I don't see either in the movie.The main problem with movies is that there is too much rush and you can't use your time well.So it's worth seeing, but maybe it did better."
"I did not fall asleep during the movie. nail. This movie was impossible. <br /> <br /> Many people claim to be superior to horror movies in the United States over Japanese horror movies, but the movie has become a rich lesson. Likewise, the movie was 30 minutes too long. It helped if the movie moved a little further in plot and camera work, but only awkward silence and slow movement.

"What can i say? A lot of people here weren't that bad. The only reason I watched this movie I've never heard of before was about IAN McSHANE. <br /> <br /> At least I was not disappointed. IAN McSHANE was absolutely wonderful and brought amazing subtleties to his role. He's always good looking and for my money... an extremely exploited actor. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie. ...

"Originally harped as a sequel to ""The Slumber Party Massacre"" series, this film falls flat on it's face with a new title. First off, if you are going to include the word ""massacre"" in your film's title, you better deliver. This one certainly does not.There is no gore, no on screen murders and no chainsaw, as the box art would lead you to believe. Instead, we get a paper thin, overdone plot about a group of cheerleaders who get stranded in an abandoned cabin on the way to a football game, only to be offed one by one. Again, this film could have been OK if the gore quotient was upped a bit. Why directors, especially those doing direct-to-video flicks, are afraid to show ANY gore is beyond me. Now, I am not a huge fan of excessive gore, but come on...why else would anyone rent a movie called ""Cheerleader Massacre??"" Besides that problem, the film suffers from a shot-on -a-home-video-camera cheapness.It looks cheap, sounds cheap, and the actors aren't all that good.It tries to throw us o ff track to who the killer may be, but even that fails.The ending ends up being a ridiculous mess.

"The murderer, cannibal rapist, was recently killed by a crazy police officer at the murder scene. In his tomb, the cult gathered with a plan to revive him by pissing on it. This works, of course, and he tears the penis up and wakes it up to his old murderous way in a completely new zombie shape. Two policemen, who are a little crazy about the city's garbage and have drug problems, have returned to the case. Two of the first cult members are trying to stop the killer by resurrecting a different kind of dead. I thought they left, but if they don't come out of the grave, they come out with a plastic baby doll that was originally used for resurrection. It's a bit confusing, but not very much trash. <br /> <br /> The play is terrible and one of the cops is like the one who played Dr. Vincent Van Gore in the face of the Gore series. As an annoying cop in this film, other cops are trying to get rid of his terrible lines. I participated in all the budget cinemas, but this movie is terrible. If it wasn't so easy on the snow ladies and their naked body, they probably fell asleep. There is a little bit of gore, but it is not an animal container placed in the victim's stomach. On the other hand, the zombie makeup looks great and is sometimes fun to rape the victim with his foot-length penis. There are also half the scenes where the killer falls in love with a sex doll. The doll with a squirrel voice is the stupidest thing I have ever seen in a movie. It's just a plastic toy on a fishing line. <br /> <br /> The ending is very bad. You will expect the killer to fight much more than you do. God let them make a sequel","The murderer, the cannibal rapist, was killed by a crazy policeman at the latest murder scene.

"Heaven Day is one of the most painful, boring and meaningless movies I have ever seen. I will not recommend the shape or form in any way to others, unless you are trying to make the children fall asleep or give an aneurysm to someone God forbids. If I could go back on time and do one thing, I lit the reels before being sent to the cinema. Why? The heavenly plot is simple but very vague. The long sequence without dialogue makes up a lot of movies. The character is too shallow and stupidly stupid. The only thing that's worked is the eyes and unfortunately the ears.

"In 1929, Walt Disney director and animator Ub Iwerks changed the face of the anime by announcing the first work of the ""Silly Symphonies"" series ""The Skeleton Dance"". Iwerks and Disney have been collaborating on Disney's ""Laugh-O-Gram"" cartoon series since the early 20s. However, when Iwerks accepted the competitor's offer and left Disney to launch their own animation studio, their friendship was hit hard. It was the birth of Celebrity Productions where Iwerks continued to develop his style and skills (and where he created Flip the Frog's character). His work maintained the same quality, but was not really popular, and in 1936 the studio was closed. Later that year, Iwerks was hired by Columbia Pictures, and this time Iwerks decided to return to his old skeleton to dance in a different color. <br /> <br /> The 1937 ""Skeleton Frolics"" is essentially a remake of 1929. The classic ""skeleton dance"", a film that brings him fame and fortune. Like that short film, it was built in an abandoned cemetery at midnight where the creatures of the night began to live and play. As the coffin group forms an orchestra and begins happy coordination, the dead ascension in the coffin is ready to begin. Now, some orchestra members have problems with their body parts, so it is not easy to become a musician consisting of only bones. However, the band has a good show and other skeleton groups start dancing. A wonderful couple of them face the same problem that plagues the orchestra. It is difficult to dance with loose body parts. Everything is over at dawn and just before the sun rises again, a skeleton runs towards the grave. <br /> <br /> Ub Iwerks ""Skeleton Frolics"", directed and animated by himself, said, ""Skeleton dances made a decisive difference a few years ago, but Iwerks made a whole movie at Technicolor. Because of the bright shades, Iwerks are more I was able to create a visually appealing movie, and with a lot of new techniques I've practiced since leaving Disney, it's far more effective in depth and dynamism than I had previously thought. Sadly, this doesn't necessarily mean it's a better movie, but it's a ""skeleton."" It's definitely an experimental movie than dance. First of all, the movie is almost the same as what Disney did, but it's only different from music (which I'll explain in more detail later) and color effects. It undoubtedly looks beautiful, but eventually feels original.<br /> <br /> But what really hurts the movie is not the originality of the concept (after all, Iwerks is not interested in the music melody Joe DeNat made for the movie, and the charm of Carl W. Stalling playing ""The Skeleton Dance"") And it's amazing that there's a lack of whimsical fun: In other words, DeNat's songs are effective and fit for themes, but Stalling's songs are easy to forget while having a unique and unforgettable personality. So the mediocrity of the music brings Iwerk's perfect animation, personally, through better music accompaniment, ""Skeleton Frolics"" and ""Skelleton Dance with Nothing"" are still fun movies, so I think they will be remembered very much. <br /> <br /> It is sad that most of the work Iwerks performed after leaving Disney was forgotten because of his success. However, even if Iwerks lack the popularity of Disney or Fleischer (the main competitor of Disney), he must say that the quality has not deteriorated. Perhaps it was a bad luck that the person who gave the Disney Mouse life first faced a failure in Disney. Despite its drawbacks, ""Skeleton Frolics"" is very fun and visually breathtaking. The movie is not the most original and fresh movie (but watching that movie)","1929年、ウォルトディズニーディレクターとアニメーターであるUb Iwerksは、「Silly Symphonies」シリーズの最初の作品「The Skeleton Dance」をリリースして、アニメーションの顔を変えました。 IwerksとDisneyは、20代前半からDisneyの ""Laugh-O-Gram""アニメシリーズで協力してきました。しかし、アイワークスが競合他社からディズニーを離れて独自のアニメーションスタジオを立ち上げるという申し出を受け入れたとき、彼らの友情は途方もない打撃を受けました。それがセレブリティプロダクションズの誕生であり、アイワークスは彼のスタイルとテクニックを開発し続けました（そして彼はフリップザカエルのキャラクターを作成しました）。彼の作品は同じ高品質を保ちましたが、あまり人気がなく、1936年までにスタジオは閉鎖されました。その年の後半に、Iwerksはコロンビアピクチャーズに雇われ、Iwerksは古いスケルトンに戻って別のダンスに戻ることにしました。今回はカラーです。<br /> <br /> 1937の「Skeleton Frolics」は基本的に1929のリメイクです。彼の名声と富を生んだ映画「クラシックスケルトンダンス」。その短編映画のように、それは放棄された墓地に設定されており、そこでは真夜中に生き物の夜が生きてきて遊び始めます。骸骨のグループがオーケストラを形成し、幸せな曲を演奏し始めると、彼らの棺からの死の立ち上がり、これから始まるショーの準備ができています。現在、一部のオーケストラのメンバーは体の部分に問題があるため、骨だけで構成されるミュージシャンになるのは簡単ではありませんが、バンドはなんとかうまくショーを披露し、別のグループのスケルトンが踊り始めます。それらの美しいカップルは、オーケストラを悩ませたのと同じ問題に直面しています：ゆるい体の部分で踊ることは難しいです。すべてが夜明けに終わり、太陽が再び昇ろうとする直前に、スケルトンは墓に向かって走ります。<br /> <br /> Ub Iwerks自身が監督およびアニメーション化した「Skeleton Frolics」は、「 「スケルトンダンス」は何年も前ですが、決定的な違いはありますが、アイワークスは映画全体をテクニカラーで行いました。明るい色調により、アイワークスはより視覚的に魅力的な映画を作成し、ディズニーを離れて以来彼が実践してきた多くの新しい技術を使用することができ、以前に考えていたものよりもさらに深みとダイナミズムの効果を生み出しました。確かに「スケルトンダンス」よりも実験的な映画ですが、悲しいことに、これは必ずしも優れた映画であるとは限りません。手始めに、映画は彼がディズニーでやったものと実質的に同じですが、唯一の違いは音楽（後で詳しくは）と色の効果です。見た目は美しく、疑いようはありませんが、結局のところ独創的ではないように感じます。<br /> <br />ただし、コンセプトに独創性がないため、本当に映画に悪影響を与えたわけではありません（結局、Iwerksがそれを実行しているのです）素晴らしい方法ですが、Joe DeNatが映画のために作成した音楽のメロディーは非常に興味深く、Carl W. Stallingが「The Skeleton Dance」で行ったものの魅力的な優雅さと気まぐれな楽しみに欠けているという事実。言い換えれば、DeNatの曲は効果的でテーマに適していますが、Stallingの曲はそれを忘れられないようにするユニークな個性を持っている一方で、すぐに忘れがちです。ミュージカル映画であるため、これは非常に重要です。そのため、音楽の平凡さがIwerkの完璧なアニメーション作品を落とし込んでいます。個人的には、より良い音楽の伴奏があれば、「スケルトンフロリック」は「スケルトンダンス」と同じくらい画期的なものではなく、楽しい映画であることを思い出すと思います。<br /> <br />親切です悲しいことに、Iwerksがディズニーを去った後に行った仕事のほとんどは、彼の貧弱な成功のために今忘れられていますが、IwerksがDisneyまたはFleischer（Disneyの主要なライバル）の人気を欠いていた場合、彼はそれらの会社の映画です。おそらく、ディズニーのマウスに初めて命を与えた男がディズニーの失敗に直面したのは、おそらく不運のせいでした。その欠点にも関わらず、「スケルトンフロリック」は非常に面白く、視覚的に息をのむようなものです映画は、最も独創的で新鮮な映画ではありませんが（見ながら「スケルトンダンス」を考えるのは仕方がありません）、Iwerkのスケルトンがまだ私たちを悩まし、私たちを鼓舞するためにここにいることをはっきりと思い出させてくれます。 <br /> <br /> 8/10"
"Yes, it could actually be a good movie. Unfortunately, it's a funny story of the wrongly talked love angle (Poetic license is sorry, but not a triangle!).

". I've seen 6 different types of WC fields-he's been in it for about 10 minutes and has long scenes, the famous infamous pool sequence from Bodville and other great moments, and I'm also glad to have a 55 minute restock. Because of the interesting Charlie Ruggles like Pinkham Whinney. He is everyone's foil. He stopped talking and stumbled over our joy. Also, his comedy partner Mary Boland plays the wife Flora. George Burns and Gracie Allen are involved in the process. Boland is particularly fun near the beginning and end, but Gracie and Ruggles use most of the pictures. Gracie is funny, but can be tiring. And poor George Burns has nothing to do except repeat Gracie all the time. I can't remember laughing at him once. (I have a nice scene with Ruggles, but Ruggles desperately tries to let George take Gracie and leave him and his wife for a while, and Fields sell him a sweater to Fields..... that beat is exclusively Fields' ) Whinneys wants to drive to California, but George and Gracie have been hired to support the expenses 8/10.","I saw WC's Six of a Kind Fields-he only appeared for about 10 minutes, had one long scene, and had some great moments, including the notorious pool sequence that became famous in Boardville.

Comedy partner Mary Borland also plays his wife Flora. Participating in the minutes are George Burns and Gracie Allen. Borland is especially entertaining near the beginning and end, but Gracie and Ruggles have run out of most of their pictures. Gracie is funny, but she can get tired.

"This movie is lame and not fun at all. Conspiracy does not make sense. Some scientists working on the outskirts of science open the doorway to another dimension (perhaps hell ???) and his daughter sucked through him or something, then one day she came back and for no apparent reason she wore big breasts and wear . Unpleasant outfit (Do you think the devil of another dimension made it for her?) The protagonist wants to marry his girlfriend, but apparently she is more interested in a new girlfriend and falls over this witch because she is gay. The magic book (they want to be a witch or something ???) and the evil spell will be read again. Demon Demon is about how only the best girls in bikinis and smashed men on the planet can definitely stop. There are people who say that the topless scene and my boyfriend is a well-known wrestler for no reason, but his part is completely unnecessary. Obviously, the wrestling fan could actually watch a pointless movie, so he made something to put him in. The topless girls won't hurt either. The DVD's add-on was much more confusing than the rest of the movies. It may help explain the progress, but it actually made the situation more confusing. Who are these people and what are they doing? Basically, this is a monster movie that camps and then fights, but there are many more things like different dimensions and book sellers than to get confused. I didn't like the movie, but it was only about five dollars. It's too silly, but I don't recommend watching it.

"Imagine this: .... Except for the high school boarding school, children have no parents Oh, and they are in Malibu and the children are all thin, white and colorful Exceptionally, a small number of obese children have a ""strange"" banishment. There are no reasonable rules, such as dorm nuclear weapons, coffee stands, sushi bars, and free laptops per student. <br /> <br /> The story is as follows.

She needs to go back to school and learn how to edit. <br /> <br /> However, the film El Padrino is a pure 10-action epic. Why can't most people direct a movie that makes you wonder what a conspiracy is? I'm so happy to see someone I know who is a really great actor become a great director. <br /> <br /> I'm one of those people who love to see artists make it. <br /> <br /> BS"

"I was very young, but attracted to a ""friend"" by a scored soundtrack, but became a famous Elton John seen at a club near Houston. I didn't know what emotion and effect it would have on the movie. Recently I came back to the movie through a song Heart called ""Seasons"", and I thought Elton John's song ""Friends"" was the same song. 35 years have passed. Anyway, the flood of ""friends"" sentiment is back as you see old photos of your first real love. I forgive me for a rather poor review, as I recall more of the way the film hit me than the actual details of production, conspiracy, etc. I remember having two special friends dating for a date. I am anxious and nervous that I want to find a copy and see it now. Many of the movies that seemed very important to me at the time (ie ""Graduation"" and ""Easy Rider"") now look silly and I don't want this to fall into the same category. But if I found it and it turned out to be silly, I would at least be able to make my wife a great soundtrack. When we met, we did this with ""The Last Tango in Paris"". The young people I work with (56 years old) respect my opinion, but it's difficult to describe the feelings of the sixties and movies and songs that reflect those strong feelings, but it seems to be a bit ""aged"" now. I can't figure out whether the aging process is a movie or me. ""Friends"" is a very special, sensitive and wonderful movie. It will definitely evoke many special emotions. Be sure to borrow or buy a copy...

"During the Clete Roberts preface, I was beginning to think this was an Ed Wood production, however, what rolls out here is some pretty hard hitting stuff.The story of crime and corruption in a Southern town is told using a cast culled from Hollywood's Poverty Row, and this makes the movie all the more realistic.There are no punches pulled here, and at times the film is reminiscent of ""The Well"" (1951). The Black and White texture gives a newsreel-like quality. For certain, younger viewers will be reminded of ""The Blair Witch Project"" but this one IS based on REAL events!",クリート・ロバーツの序文の間に、私はこれがエド・ウッドのプロダクションであると思い始めていましたが、ここで展開されるのは、かなりハードなヒット作品です。南部の町での犯罪と汚職の話は、ハリウッドの貧困者の列から選別されたキャストを使用して伝えられ、これにより映画がより現実的になります。ここに引っ張られたパンチはありません、そして時には映画は「ウェル」（1951）を連想させます。黒と白のテクスチャは、ニュースリールのような品質を提供します。確かに、若い視聴者には「The Blair Witch Project」が思い出されますが、これはREALイベントに基づいています！

"Moms should actually be given different titles to distinguish them from movies with different titles or from other movies titled Moms. <br /> <br /> This is a very good zombie movie compared to a lot of garbage.

"The Empire of Passion begins deceptively. In other words, if you expect to become a horror movie immediately. It is the same reef as James M. Cain's The Postman Always The Rings at Two. But when he's not around and she's at home with her baby, a fuss-free and purposeless young man Toyoji (Tatsuya Fuji) will bring some benefit to Seki. They're sleeping together soon, but after he does something to her (let's say ""between""), he knows what he'll figure out and proposes to kill Gisaburo immediately. They drank him, strangled him, then threw the well. Naturally, these will come back to bother them. But it turns them into gears for the Japanese ghost story'Kaidan', at least to them (only in the first super-powered Seki and later in the skeptical Toyoji). <br /> <br /> This is not just a horror coming from ""Oh, ghost, ah"", but for the characters. It's a movie coming out of a total horror, unlike the American city or a small city (e.g., snooping police,'evidence police' found elsewhere), there's the dynamics of the movie Noir in action when it's loosely translated through 19th-century Japanese villages. , The words move around or evoke suspicion, etc.). Seiko objected to the plan from the beginning, was pleasantly manipulated by ready-made Toyoji, and her reaction to the reproduction of the Knights Department was shocking to her. Find the place closest to the current affairs. The ghost of the knight Buro, a pale blue face, mostly silent and apathetic stare, Seiko's rickshaw movement. She reluctantly, surrounded by smoke for hours before dawn, pushes her in a way she doesn't know. Most Japanese ghost stories want to make a wish for heaven. <br /> <br /> I'm starting to fall in love with hysteria until the end, but there's so much that Oshima director has come up with to create this unique piece. In the international film industry, hit hard by In The Realm of the Senses (prohibited in his country), he claimed to have made the'Senses' bolder. Perhaps he was right. The Empire of Passion has less graphic content than its predecessors (starring Tatsuya, a great physical actor with a huge range), but is in creating a world of bold fear. You can believe in ghosts in this story, but you have to believe in the distance to your own personal hell to become these two parakeet. Detective Snooping or the people of the gossip villages have the least to worry about. The soul's destiny is in danger. <br /> <br /> Oshima takes what might be a juicy pulp on the other hand (unfortunately, it's not surprising if an American remake is already included in the work) aerial shots are repeated and the wrong scene (eg Seiko and The scene where Toyoji walks the road, shot after a gorgeous shot with a Dutch camera), angles, the world is tilted and surrounded by a dark blue tint) as well as affecting the movements that will stay for a long time after completing this input (ie. Throwing leaves in one hand into a well in slow motion or how Seiko's nude body is revealed after she becomes blind). It is bold not to be confused with the spirit, but to connect to the level of the mind. However, the relationship between life and death is inseparable. It's a classic waiting to be discovered.","At first glance, Empire of Passion begins when you expect it to be a horror movie. Like the first riff of James M. Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice. Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) is the mother of two, a diligent and diligent wife of rickshaw driver Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamurahiro). But when he's not near, when she's at home with her baby, the motivated and purposeless young man Toyoji (Tatsuya Fuji) brings some goodies to Seki, and a little extra. They're sleeping together right away, but after he's done something to her (let's just say ""shave""), he knows he can see that they kill Gisaburo. Will promptly propose. They drink him, strangle him, and throw him into a well. Naturally, this comes back to bother them-but it literally turns gears into a Japanese ghost story ""Kaidan"", at least for them (first only in super-terrifying Seki and then in skeptical Toyoji). I will. <br /> <br /> This is a film that was born out of an entire horror horror was built for the character, not just from ""Ah, ghost, ah"". In one sense, the film noir mechanics are totally functional when translated roughly through a 19th-century Japanese village, as opposed to American cities and small towns (that is, snooping cop, Perhaps ""evidence"" found by another person), word movement, suspicion, etc.). Sperm was against the plan from the beginning, but it is persuasive because her reaction to Gisaburo's reappearance is astounding to her, manipulated by greedy but poorly prepared Toyoharu. We will pick the one closest to the poem. The ghost of Gisaburo, the pale blue face, and the calm gaze surrounded by silence, the motion of Seiko riding a rickshaw. She reluctantly does, and he pushes her into a way she doesn't know, surrounded by smoke early in the dawn. Most of the haunted stories in Japan want a paradise where you can get this tragic atmosphere. <br /> <br /> While starting to make a hysterical turn towards the end, Oshima makes this a prominent piece. Something he claimed to be even ""more"" bold ""Senses"" after a blockbuster in the international film world in In the Realm of the Senses (ironically banned in his country) I made. Maybe he was right. Empire of Passion has less graphic content than its predecessor (and stars a spectacular physical actor, Fuji Tatsuya, with a much wider range), but its audacity lies in creating a world of fear. You can believe in ghosts in this story, but you have to believe how far you can go to their personal hell that will be these two lovers. Snooping detectives or rumored townspeople are least of their concern: their very soul destiny is at stake. <br /> <br /> And Oshima takes what might otherwise be just juicy pulp (sadly surprise if t American remakes are already in progress) And after the gorgeous shots, the craft was filmed, and the iterations went on to miss scenes (that is, shots of Seiko and Touji walking down the road, a Dutch camera), angles, tilted worlds, and those. With some shades of Grim blue), and some influential movements that will stay with me for a long time after I've typed this (ie Toyoji throws a leaf into a well with one hand in slow motion, or Seiko The naked body will be revealed after she lost her sight). Bold is connecting at the spiritual level. Do not be confused with the spiritual. Similarly, the interrelationship between life and death is not complicated. It's a classic waiting to be discovered."
"I am not a big music video fan. I think music videos take away personal feelings about a particular song. All songs. In other words, creative thinking comes out of the window.

"Oh My God. I wouldn't have thought that a thriller could soon get worse than a domestic family disorder. But here it is. Sanctimony is a movie that is forced to re-evaluate almost every genre, armed with rotten conspiracy, terrible editing, malicious acting and headache-inducing'style' (sorry, nothing else). In other words, the film is so bad that even the thriller who accused him of complete failure seems to be a little better now. <br /> <br /> Now Sanctimony is not only a terrible film in itself, but it also succeeds in difficult tasks. It extracts better movies and does a pathetic job. I was impressed that something wasn't very good, and the movie had an unpleasant image. As soon as I started with a series of keratin, hip hip quick cuts filled with explosive colors, I knew where the smell came from. <br /> <br /> Two police officers, Jim Renart (Michael Paré) and police officer Dorothy Smith (Jennifer Rubin), are investigating a murder in Vancouver. A serial killer known as ""Monkey Killer"" killed many people with his work method. As you know, this nut works according to the saying, ""Don't look at evil, hear evil, don't speak evil"" and cut off the victim's eyes, ears and tongue. So far there are 6 eyes, 6 ears and 3 tongues. In a very original way, Renart and Smith thought the Monkey Killer would probably kill three others. Because he probably wants to complete 666. So suddenly the film focuses on Tom Gerrick (Casper Van Dien). Young, successful, handsome businessman, terrible. And that's where the American Psycho defeat begins. <br /> <br />We follow the life of the two Gyeonggi Passes. The disco, which Renart barely overlooked Gerrick in the process, recently gave us one of the most memorable and entertaining scenes. Renart enters the back of the disco club. Because... the script tells us that we are a suspect place;..? Then, with a single punch in the stomach, Renard removes the big guard blocking the road, and the guards are never heard again. This scene completely slanders others <br /> <br /> Anyway after another murder, Gerrick Returned as a witness, but Smith and especially Renart immediately suspect he was the murderer. In a typical basic instinct way, a young businessman under the assumption that Smith can discover his true identity. Go on a date with <br /> <br /> It doesn't spoil the ending, but it's very simple and embarrassing;. There are contradictions, some conspiracy holes, unsolved problems, and the last scene that seems to be ridiculously excessive and meaningless, frankly unthinkable, brutal mass murders that are considered shocking and sad. Everyone could not laugh. <br /> <br /> At 87 minutes Sanctimony is actually pushing it. You don't care about a single character at all because you know exactly who you're seeing for the first time. If the scene is unnecessary and unsuitable, it will not be attracted to the story because it will be connected via a weak plot device. The range of acting ranges from the average (Van Dien) to completely terrible (Rubin and most support casts). Music is a terrible general techno and photography is the worst I've ever seen. Of course, like all immortality in the genre, we are given a bit of overexposure. <br /> <br /> 3/10","Oh well. You wouldn't expect thrillers to be seen this sooner than domestic interference, but here they are. Armed with rogue intrigue, horrible editing, awkward acting, and headache-inducing ""style"" (sorry, I have no other words), Sanctimony is almost a force to re-evaluate the whole genre. Is a movie. I mean, this movie is so bad that even the thriller I accused of as a complete failure seems to have gotten a bit better. <br /> <br /> Now Sanctimony is not only a terrifying movie in its own right, but also successful in some difficult tasks. Peel a better movie and do a pathetic job with it. From the main title-nothing but an explicit attempt to recreate the title from Se7en-I got the impression that something didn't smell perfectly. When the film began with a series of hip-quick cuts that wanted to be hip, full of blasphemy images and bomb colors, I knew where the smell came from. <br /> <br /> Two cops turned out, or rather cop Jim Renard (Michael Palais) and cop Dorothy Smith (Jennifer Rubin) are investigating murder cases in Vancouver .. A serial killer known as ""Monkey Killer"" (a scary, horrifying nickname, um?) killed quite a few. The nut apparently works according to the adage, ""I don't see evil, don't hear evil, don't speak evil,"" cutting off eyes, ears, and tongue from victims. So far, 6 eyes, 6 ears, 3 tongues. In a very original way, Renato and Smith understand that Monkey Killer is probably trying to kill the other three. Well, he probably wants to complete 666. So suddenly the movie focuses on Tom Jerrick, Casper Van Dien, a young and successful good-looking businessman with a terrifying disposition. And that is where American Psycho's rip-off begins. <br /> <br /> So we track the life of two police officers and a young psychopath. Along the way, Renart has almost missed Gerrick and the disco offers one of the weirdest scenes of recent memory. Renart goes behind the disco club. Because he says the script is a suspect. Location; Then, with one punch in the abdomen, Renard removes the large guard blocking the pass. Can't you hear the guard again? Is this scene hitting anyone else as completely unrealistic? <br /> <br /> Anyway, after another murder, Gerrick appears as a witness, but Smith and especially Renart immediately suspect he may be the murderer. In a typical Basic Instinct fashion, Smith makes some dates with a young businessman, under the assumption that he may discover his true identity. <br /> <br /> I don't hurt the ending, but it's a very simple embarrassing thing. Contradictions, some plotholes, unsolved problems, especially the last brutal massacre that should be shocking and sad is too laughable and foolish and frankly unimaginable. There is a scene. No one could laugh at it. <br /> <br /> At 87 minutes Sanctimony is really pushing it. You don't care about a single character. They're all flat (not to mention boring) and you can see exactly who is who when you first met. If the scene is totally unnecessary and out of place, it will be connected through a weak plotting device and will not be drawn into the story. The range of acting is from average (Vandien) to really evil (Rubin, and most supportive casts). Music is terrible generic techno, and photography is one of the worst I've ever seen. Of course, like all the blunders of this genre, we are offered a bit of rude nudity. <br /> <br /> 3/10"

"This film was basically set to fail in the studio. Anne Rice (the author of the book) offered to make a film but refused it in the studio. Second, they tried to put two in-depth novels in a two-hour movie. <br /> <br /> I keep these two books-the Vampire Restatt and the Cursed Queen-the only way to work in a live-action form. Through the mini-series, the Vampire Restatt alone arose from the 1700s to the 1980s, There are many characters that are essential for understanding the plot of the main character Restat. The entire book Vampire Lestat sets the case for the second part of the cursed queen. If the premise of a movie is not fully understood, the premise of the movie is destroyed. <br /> <br /> Lestat was brutal and not malicious to everyone, did not want to follow Akasha's plan, Marius did not make Lestat, Lestat did not love Jesse or her, Lestat was light It couldn't be left unscathed, and Marius didn't follow David, or in another way, all the characters were completely misrepresented. Basically a different story of the same name. <br /> <br /> To make a vampire movie, it's okay if you want to be inspired by this novel. But no matter the success of Rice's great novels and characters, don't come back to the theater. To destroy what loyal readers love. <br /> <br /> If you don't read the book, you will be insulted if you read it. In other words, I'm a huge fan who should be familiar with the movies, this will be the case and still went for it. You have to catch number 22.

"It's a really disappointing movie. As anyone who reads Carson McCullers knows, in a small southern town there is plenty of interpersonal complexity and the possibility to explore the dark dumbbells hidden beneath the plain surface. This does nothing. Instead, the artists settled for a cute, shiny warm fuzzy and original melodrama. It looks like a movie made for TV, but with no special distinction, it's hard to imagine what someone could do to make this material interesting. <br /> <br />, There's a lot of actors in this cast that are extremely capable and attractive. All are working game-wise to do their best and do what they can. Of course, there are no other words. The tragic waste of talent, especially the great Stockard Channing.","What a frustrating movie.

"The film starred a completely forgotten star in Jack Pearl (Radio's ""Baron Munchhausen"") and Jimmy Durante in the 1930s. However, after 7-1/2 years, it is being billed as a Three Stooges movie because it is the only movie that ordinary people can recognize today. Movie lovers will also admit the stunning Edna May Oliver as well as Zazu Pitts. <br /> <br /> Stooges is a very early film. team. At this point they were known as ""Ted Healy and his Shaman."" Fortunately, in the case of Stooges, they left this unpleasant and rather untalented person (you can see what I mean) and the rest is history. Within a year, they made a very successful shorts in Colombia, and MGM executives were kicking about losing the team soon. This kind of thing happened frequently at MGM, and I didn't know of great studios (films such as Buster Keaton, Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello) that weren't related to comedy. Indeed, until MGM left for Colombia, he played a number of strange film roles in DANCING LADY, including acting with Clark Gable and Joan Crawford. Strangely, in this film, they weren't a team. Larry played a variety of supporting roles, including playing the piano! <br /> <br /> This film is an African jungle with Pearl and Durante. When they are rescued and back home, all the sense of structure in the movie collapses and the movie looks like a variety of shows shown by scenes with leads all over the place. In the case of Pearl, I have a slug character, so I can see why I haven't successfully switched to a movie (but a bit less welcome). As for Durante, I didn't know what the public saw to him as far as his films were concerned. He had time to help MGM ruin Buster Keaton's career to make this film. Pearl and Durante rely on many verbal humor (?) and Vaudeville style routines that tend to fall flat together. It's strange to see Healy doing what Moe did in her later film. What they did in the movie was pretty good, but because all the segments were short, I couldn't get into the routine by turning the camera on or off too quickly. Stooges fans may be very disappointed with this, but die-hard fans would love to see this, even worse, due to the death of Shemp and Curly to fulfill their lifetime goals of watching Stooge, even the rotten Joe DeRita and Joe Besser movies). <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is rather dull and disappointing. However, there are some interesting things to look for in Confusion. After about 13 minutes, you can see a short scene of the tour guide singing on the bus. This is Walter Brennan, which plays a role you would certainly not expect, so take a look! Another peculiar thing to look for in the movie is the song ""Clean with Whistle,"" which starts at about 22 minutes in the movie. This song and dance number is clearly an example of a so-called ""free code"" scene that has not been allowed in movies since 1934 (with enhanced filmmaking). Despite the word ""clean"" in the title, it's a lot of irritation for a naked woman who shows a lot of flesh, but it's not enough to actually show anything. Although excesses today were quite common in the early 1930s, they are very shocking today. Finally, in 63 minutes, watch Jimmy Durante establish a racial relationship decades ago.

Another rare thing to look for in a movie is a ""flute-like"" song that begins about 22 minutes into the movie. This song and dance number is clearly an example of a ""precode"" scene and was not allowed in movies after 1934 (after the production code was strengthened). Despite the word ""clean"" in the title, it's a very exciting number where naked women are showing lots of meat-enough to inspire but not enough to actually show something There is none!

"When Carol (Vanessa Hidalgo) begins investigating her brother's death, she begins to suspect that there is more evil than ""natural causes."" The closer she gets to the truth, the greater the threat to her older sister Fiona (Helga Sun) and the local Satanists. They will do everything necessary to stop the way her nose is blocked. <br /> <br /> Black Candles offers a lot if you're into a soft, Satan-themed movie. The movie is full of nudity and conscious softcore sex. In particular, scenes involving young women and goats should be believed. Unfortunately, all the comforts of the world can not save black candles. Most of the movies are full holes. In addition to the scenes I have already mentioned, numerous sex scenes are not shocking and certainly not sexy. Acting is the best. Even the genre's favorite Helga Line offers disappointing performance. The conspiracy doesn't really matter. The main function seems to tie dull sex scenes together.

"I like this movie because it is a great piece of movie made by people who care enough to make art as well as home movies. It's packed with super surfer Greg Noll's home movies and amateur videos from others in tune with 50 years of passion. Nevertheless, it has been expanded to approach aesthetic glory. It is full of artistic talent and athletic ability, but you can think of minor surfing as an exercise. Surfers are not astronauts or test pilots. Nor is it a surgeon or doctorate. It believes in the surfer's quest. It believes in the beauty of human guppy. It believes in the great gift of peace that comes from the cessation of war. Surfers celebrate the end of the war on the northern beach of the island of Hawaii, which was attacked by Japanese zero 15 years ago. Congratulations to the downtime of the country that fought the Cold War instead of the Russian socialists. Surfing is the best self-love. Dangerous but only slightly historical. It seems that Alexander the Great was not famous for his surfing skills. He had to travel to dozens of countries to get the favorable media he received. There are no army heroes in this movie. There is no gun. The only beachfront surfer conquest has beer stands and surfboard shops. This is not a problem. Peace is not hopeless.

"Steve McQueen definitely has a lot of loyal fans. He was definitely a charismatic fellow, and one of the most charismatic on the big screen. But even McQueen can't save a turkey from a movie that looks like a brownie camera in St. Louis' physical location. <br /> <br /> McQueen is a new kid with no criminal record.

"The central message seems very blurry and the plot seems to be the result of merging several different scripts. As a result, often it doesn't make any sense at all, and it's not a movie that Miss Dunne or Mr. Huston was proud of. But if you're a fan of the ""Free Code"" movie, this movie isn't married to cool girls or partners!! <br /> <br /> The film begins with teacher Dunne, a social worker who helps the troops head to Europe for WWI. In the process, she meets Bruce Cabot and convinces her to eventually sleep with her. She is pregnant and then goes to the unsuspecting woman. However, Miss Dunne realized that he was not worth it, but later dies when the child is born. All of these controversial plot elements are used, but the audience's adults wanted to know, but almost expressing it or shooting in the right way has no clue to the audience (after all, the movie hasn't been assessed and the children are now in any movie I can attend). Again or not mentioned. It's like continuing to shoot another movie, just as if you had taken part of a movie and discarded it. In the second stage of the movie, Miss Dunne unexpectedly starts working in a female prison (actually, she doesn't actually see her do something). What we see is probably a scene of numerous terrible abuses and tortures designed to suffocate. And as a result of all this violence, Miss Dunne unfolded the temple to clean the prison, becoming a reformer and famous writer. <br /> <br /> However, another type of film appears in blue. The women's prison reform project is on the roadside. Dunne meets a married judge (Walter Huston), but desperately wants her. Throughout the movie, Dunne was portrayed as a very nice girl despite having sex with Cabot. But now, Irene, a tireless reformer and great woman, starts sleeping with a married man. He tells her that she and his wife are distant and only married by name, but will not investigate if this is true, and is doing business to undress and raise a baby with his guarantee! However, she was charged with a crooked judge while she was pregnant with her beloved child. He is convinced of her innocence to her, but she is convicted and sounds like a villain to accumulate wealth using the information from the people who came to her bench. Then at the end of the movie, Miss Dunn vainly frees him and vows to wait for the child until Hurston is released. The movie ends. <br /> <br /> So we basically have 3 individual films and a bizarre idea of ​​what a nice girl looks like in the early 30s. I have gathered that she should be a strong thinking working girl who instantly becomes an idiot in her personal relationship! This is really difficult to imagine anyone who likes movies and actually cancels all the positives about Dunne's personality. Strong women's rights advocates can easily offend how weak she is and how weak she is, and religionists can consider her a completely moral, or at least moral, suspect! With a decent rewrite, this could be a good movie, or at least interesting as an obscene, fat movie, but that was what I wanted and another dull Pre-Code movie.",その中心的なメッセージが非常に混乱していて、プロットはいくつかの異種のスクリプトをマージした結果であるように思われるので、これは悪い映画です。結果として、それはまったくまったく意味をなさないことが多く、確かにミスダンやヒューストン氏が誇りに思っていたはずの映画ではありません。ただし、「プリコード」映画のファンであれば、この映画は一見の価値があります。結婚していない場合でも、パートナーがいる場合でも、素敵な女の子は出さないということを強く主張する驚くほど滑らかなプロットが特徴です。 !! <br /> <br />映画は、第一次世界大戦のためにヨーロッパに向かう軍隊を支援するソーシャルワーカーとしてのミスダンから始まります。その過程で、彼女はスカラワグ（ブルースキャボット）に出会い、最終的に彼と一緒に寝るように説得します。彼女は妊娠し、彼は次の無防備な女性に進みます。しかし、ダンミスは、彼はそれだけの価値がないことに気づいているため、彼を取り戻すことを望んでいませんが、後に彼女の赤ちゃんは出産時に亡くなっています。これらの非常に物議を醸しているプロット要素がすべて使用されていますが、それらは常に暗示されています-聴衆の大人に知ってもらいたいのと同じように、彼らがそれを正しい方法でフレーズまたは撮影すると、聴衆の子供がなることを望みました無知（結局のところ、映画は評価されておらず、子供たちは現時点ではどんな映画にも参加する可能性があります）。<br /> <br />驚いたことに、死んだ赤ちゃんとキャボットを含むこの全体の計画は、映画の約1/4で終わりますそして再び言及されたり、暗示されたりすることはありません。それはまるで映画の一部を撮影してそれを放棄したかのようでした。映画のこの第2フェーズでは、ミスダンが予期せず女性の刑務所で働き始めました（実際に彼女がそこで何かをしているのを見ることはありません）。私たちが目にするのは、恐らく振り返るために設計された、深刻な虐待と拷問の数え切れないほどの恐ろしい場面です。そして、このすべての暴力の結果として、ダンミスは刑務所を片付けるために十字軍に参加し、改革者で有名な作家になります。<br /> <br />しかし、突然、別のタイプの映画が登場します。そして、女性の刑務所改革ビジネスは道端に行きます。ダンは結婚している裁判官（ウォルターヒューストン）に会いますが、彼は彼女を切望しています。現在、映画全体を通して、ダンは彼女がキャボットと未婚のセックスをしていたにもかかわらず、彼女は非常に良い女の子として描かれています（彼女は多かれ少なかれ騙されていました）。しかし今、疲れ知らずの改革者であり、善良な女性である独身のアイリーンは、結婚した男性と一緒に寝始めます。彼は彼と彼の妻は疎遠で名前だけで結婚していると彼女に話します、しかし彼女はこれが本当であるかどうかを調査することを決して考えません、そして彼の保証でオフは彼女の服を飛ばし、彼らは赤ん坊を作るビジネスにいます！しかし、彼女が彼の愛の子供を妊娠している間、彼は曲がった裁判官であるとして起訴されました。彼は彼女が無実であることを彼女に保証しますが、彼は有罪判決を受け、確かに彼が悪党のように聞こえます-幸運を蓄えるために彼のベンチの前に来た人々からの内部情報を使用します。その後、映画の最後の瞬間に、ミスダンは彼を解放させようと無駄に試み、ヒューストンが解放されるまで子供と一緒に待つことを誓います。その後、映画は終了します。<br /> <br />つまり、基本的には3つの別々の映画と、素敵な女の子がどうあるべきかについての奇妙な30代前半のアイデアがあります。私は彼女が個人的な関係の中ですぐにばかになる強い志向の働く女の子であるべきであると集めました！これは、ダンの性格についてのすべての良い面を完全に覆し、映画を好きな人を想像するのは本当に難しいです。強い女性の権利擁護者は、彼女がいかに弱気で困窮しているか、そして宗教的な人々が彼女を完全に非道徳的であるか、少なくとも道徳的に疑わしいと見なすかもしれないことに簡単に腹を立てるかもしれません！まともな書き直しがあれば、これは良い映画であるか、少なくともスケベで卑劣な映画として興味深いものだったかもしれませんが、それが何になりたかったのか、まったく別の退屈なプレコード映画だったのかを決めることができませんでした。
"I recently watched this movie on the Sci-Fi channel. Indeed, it turned out to be pretty good as long as a B-list horror/suspension movie appeared. The two (one innocent and one with a big mouth) went on a trip to stop the marriage, but they were fickle and makeshift tank/truck hybrid maniacs. Things get more complicated when they pick up the ridiculous hitchhiker. What makes this movie unique is that, unlike many other movies, the combination of comedy and terrorism actually works in this movie. The two are good enough and have a good chase/suspension scene. With great pacing and comic timing, this movie is easier to pass than horror/slasher buffs. Worth checking out.","I recently found this movie on the Sci-Fi channel. In fact, I found it pretty decent when it comes to B-list horror/suspense movies.

Things get even more complicated when they pick up ridiculously wild hitchhikers.

"(Very gentle spoiler; basic plot outline, no details). <br /> <br /> Your expectations are low enough when you enter this movie. I saw this movie in Maryland a few days ago at a free screening. The only reason I agreed to agree. ... because it is free. I expected a little laugh, but not much more than that, as I have never been a big fan of Tenacious D. <br /> <br /> The first 10 minutes of the movie was as fun as we can see. Jack Black's humble Christian originated in a city in the midwestern United States. The film takes us years into the future, the first meeting of Tenacious D's late JB and Kyle Gass. We see the formation of the band and the origin of its name. Finally, as the title suggests, the second half of the film details their quest to get the legendary ""Pick of Destiny"". Again, the beginning of the movie laughed loudly, and most movies smiled at least on my face. It said there was a time when I felt a little long. It was only 100 minutes, but it still seemed a bit shorter. The story is as ridiculous as it sounds, and it's not a movie you see if you want a real plot. It's okay, except that a lot of jokes are very much missed or missed... and if they miss, they miss. Songs are the same. It is a musical, but many songs have lost their appeal after the first minute. It will continue though. <br /> <br /> R-rated will say that this movie has actually been saved from bombing. D's humor simply didn't work without cussing, sex, and drug references. But if you're not a true fan of the band, or at least don't know you appreciate the comedy style, it's a good idea to save money and rent. ""Pick"" will make you giggle a bit... but is it worth $9? I don't think so. I wanted to rate it as 6, but 7 seems more appropriate because many people think it will be enough to justify watching it in the theater. Make sure it is your style.",（非常に穏やかなネタバレ、基本的なプロットのアウトライン、実際の詳細はありません）<br /> <br />十分に低い期待でこの映画に行く場合。数日前にメリーランド州で無料上映会でこの映画を見た、そして私が行くことに同意した唯一の理由はそれが無料だったからだった。私はいくつかの笑いを期待していましたが、Tenacious Dの大ファンではなかったので、それ以上ではありません。<br /> <br />映画の最初の10分間は、ジャックブラックの謙虚なキリスト教の起源は、中西部のアメリカの町にあります。その後、この映画は私たちを何年も先に、JBとテネシャスDの後半であるカイルガスの間の最初の会議に連れて行きます。バンドの形成とその名前の起源がわかります。最後に、タイトルが示すように、映画の後半には、伝説の「運命のピック」を入手するための彼らの探求が詳述されています。再び、映画の冒頭は大声で笑い声で笑いました、そして、ほとんどの映画は少なくとも私の顔に笑顔を保ちました。とはいえ、少し長く感じることもありました。わずか100分ですが、それでも少し短かったように感じました。物語は、それが聞こえるのと同じくらいばかげている、そしてこれはあなたが本当の陰謀が欲しいかどうか見るあなたが見る映画ではありません。これは問題ありませんが、ジョークの多くが非常にヒットまたはミスです。曲についても同じことが言えます。それはミュージカルですが、曲の多くは最初の1分ほどで魅力を失いました...それからとにかく進み続けました。<br /> <br /> Rレーティングはこの映画を爆撃から本当に救ったと言いますDのユーモアは、口論、セックス、薬物への言及なしでは機能しませんでした。しかし、あなたがバンドの真のファンでない限り、または少なくともコメディーのスタイルに感謝していることを知っているのでない限り、私はあなた自身にいくらかのお金と家賃を節約することをお勧めします。 「ピック」はあなたを少し笑わせるでしょう...しかし、それは9ドルの価値がありますか？私はそうは思いません。私はそれを6と評価するように誘惑されましたが、多くの人がそれを劇場で見るのを正当化するのに十分楽しんでいると思うので、7がより適切であると思われます。それがあなたのスタイルであることを確認してください。
"Let's start with a disclaimer. This movie is not recommended for anyone who is not interested in gaming or has never played FF7 before watching. The movie relies on the audience's knowledge of each character in the game to convey story plot elements. And it is very subtle. I promise you that if you do your homework before watching this wonderful CG movie, you will be much better. <br /> <br /> With that in mind, this movie has some of the coolest CG sequences I've ever seen. The whole experience felt like a long FMV sequence of games on steroids. Yes. In each scene, especially in heavy action-oriented scenes, the attention to detail was so flawless that I felt awe. <br /> <br /> I think the soundtrack has been simplified so that the audience can focus on it. For those familiar with FF7 stories and backgrounds, music should not scare others (the timing and placement of each original soundtrack up to the point where music simply enhances animation for each scene and mood). <br /> <br /> Once again, playing only once through FF7 thoroughly enjoyed this piece of art from Square Enix. And that's the choreographed and organized feeling in most scenes. Like a dance. <br /> <br /> In other words, if you enjoyed music or the game Final Fantasy 7, this movie will blow you out of the water. Unfortunately, the vast majority of people who have never experienced the advantage of FF7 on a Playstation or PC can do so much more before doing a movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, I just record the animation quality of this movie. The character moves fluidly. Each scene background is vivid and tells your own story. For those who criticize the thinness and dependence of the story plot, I urge you to review the animation again. Facial reactions, subtle clues that provide a higher level of entertainment than typical storytelling. <br /> <br /> Square Enix and the great Tetsuya Nomura set new standards for high-quality animation and storytelling. Advent Children has opened a new era of CG animation. The subtlety of each character allows you to speak for yourself. <br /> <br /> Square Square Enix. Waiting was worth it.","Let me start with the disclaimer: This movie is not recommended for anyone who is not interested or who has never played an FF7 game before watching.

"This is probably one of the worst movies. Everything about acting, directing, script, and filming is terrible. The alien (shining person) claims to be from a nearby universe. One assumes that the script writer means ""Galaxy"", but did not check his term by taking a dictionary. The better title of the movie is from ""Plot of Planet of Conlotvances"". Conspiracy is too stupid and plaster rarely exists. Humans are endowed with a magical MacGuffin that follows a series of winding series of rules to move a bare-handed plot. The thought of the passage of time is ignored. Now, a few days after meeting the alien, BAM! Suddenly a few hours left until zero. Be courteous and miss this movie. You will make you more stupid about seeing it. The ending is especially silly and someone says ""Ta-Da !!!!"" The scriptwriter randomly pulled something out of his ass. Because of this, the real alien conspiracy thinks that this movie will be so bad that you will see cancer.","This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. Everything about it-acting, director, screenplay, filmmaking-is horrifying. Aliens, humans in shimmering clothing, claim to come from a nearby universe. I assume that the writer means ""galaxy"", but I didn't mind getting a dictionary to check his terms. A better title for the movie would be ""born from a conspiracy plot"". The plot is very stupid and almost nonexistent. Every human being is given a magical McGuffin that fits an unlikely series of winding restrictions to drive just a plot. Any thoughts about the passage of time are ignored. A few days after I met an alien, BAM! Suddenly, there are only 2 hours left until 0 hours. Ask yourself and miss this movie. You will make yourself stupid by seeing it. The ending is especially ridiculous, so there should be some people who say ""Dauda!!!!"". Because the screenwriter just pulls something randomly from his ass. I think the real alien conspiracy is that this movie is so terrifying that you see it and become cancerous. If you can see the last 10 minutes without laughing yourself (""enemy of freedom""-honestly), you are late."
"If an ant really likes a movie that conquers the world with a story by making a dust mirror and making a voice without eating an ant, this is the movie for you. Basically, two scientists working in the creature dome communicate with a highly intelligent ant (the most intelligent actor in this movie), trying to thwart the plan of conquest and eradication. Throughout the film, two scientists (and a girl rescued from an ant) ​​use everything at their disposal (computer, green dye, terrible smoke), but to no avail. I guess I couldn't have bought the pesticide because the movie ended too soon. <br /> <br /> The title of the movie ""Phase IV"" is a mystery. This is not a spoiler, but ""Phase I"" starts immediately after the start credit, while ""Phase IV"" is not reached until the final credit rolls back. Since the director knew that the film would be boring, steps 1-3 were placed as progress reports throughout the film. As an MST3K episode, this was not good for two reasons. 1) KTMA's riffing when it first started in season 0 is not as good as later seasons. And 2) this film can't even brighten J&TB. There are one or two Gamera references when they finished rippering five Gamera movies.","If you really really enjoy the movie where Ali makes a dirt mirror, eats a non-ant and conquers the world with narration, then this is the movie for you.

"Joseph Brady and Clarence Two Little had a four-day coastal vacation in Hollywood with two sailors; Joe knows everything about the girl and can't wait to see Lola. Then you meet Donald Martin, a young boy who ran away to join the Navy. They meet a beautiful Susan, who wants to take him home and become a singer. Shame is lost, but I am not ashamed of the waitress from Brooklyn. Joe knew he was in love with Susie. George Sidney's Anchors Aweigh (1945) is a great music comedy, once again a top-notch music comedy in his songs and dances. Frank Sinatra is a shameful person in Brooklyn and is great. Shameful thinking is not the first thing that comes to mind when thinking. Catherine Grayson is fantastic, like Susan Abbott, and lost a talented actress and opera soprano at the age of 88 last month. Jose Iturbi plays magically in the piano. Edgar Kennedy is the police chief, Sara Berner is the voice of Jerry Mouse. Kelly and Sinatra performing ""We Hate to Leave"" are really lively. It's a good moment when Frank sings Brahms, ""You know Susie if you know Susie."" 'Lullaby of Dean Stockwell. It's lovely to hear Grayson sing the tango ""Jealousy"". The most memorable sequence is what appears in the animated fantasy world. There as a butler. They were originally nominated for Oscars, but Georgie Stoll took first place with the Original Music Score, and Anchors Aweigh is a luxury entertainment.","Joseph Brady and Clarence Doolittle are two sailors on a four-day coastal vacation in Hollywood.

"From the director of Barbet Schroder (Fortune of Retune), I saw a bit of content in the media research class and tried it despite critics' evaluation because it recognized the best actress.

Investigating the murder case, along with new partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), is a homicide detective Cassie'The Hyena' Mayweather (Sandra Bullock). Unrelated hair. Kathy and Sam have Richard or Justin as suspects very quickly, so the plan doesn't seem to work. They also call Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills, Chris Penn as Captain Ray Feathers, Captain RD Rod Cody, and Tom Verica as Asst. DA Al Swanson.

"It is one of the worst movies ever made and is a fatal prosecution for talentless hacking in the UK film industry as well as at work today.

"This movie is a riot. I can't remember when I had such a good time in the movie. I've seen good comedies a few times in my time, but it's usually quite fun. But this is a big line from wall to wall. I think Best in Show is the last movie I laughed so hard. The film didn't stop until it cleared the sentimental plot for 5 minutes. Other than that, it's a continuous shooter for one liner and goofy situation. I want to see it again before leaving the theater. Because this is like a Zucker movie that doesn't make any jokes at first. As far as the actual movie goes, we may have used better editing features, and sometimes it's uneven, but we have to forgive. <br /> <br /> That. All characters are great. The Adam Sandler movie is fun and others suffer around and are jokes ass. I think I will remember all the protagonists for years to come because all the protagonists like it all. There are no victims in this movie. Also thank you for allowing the 45 year old actress to play his girlfriend. Catherine Keener plays her and she is a lover in this movie. I hope women like her actually exist. She's not ""10"" like other famous women, but her smile is hotter than Julia Roberts smiles too much than overeating. I am sure it does not define you a trailer. They do not give up all good jokes. It's just some of the ordinary things. <br /> <br /> Oh and one more thing. I wish critics would put it on the top 10 list. Many of them complain that comedies are not recognized for their value and are not listed on the end of the year. This means you are EVER!!!",この映画は暴動です。最後に映画で素晴らしい時間を過ごしたのを思い出せません。私は自分の時間にいくつかの良いコメディを見てきましたが、通常、それらはかなり面白いです。しかし、これは壁から壁までの素晴らしいラインです。ベストインショーは、私が一生懸命に笑った最後の映画だと思います。5分のセンチメンタルプロットの片付けを行う最後まで、映画はノンストップでした。それ以外は、1つのライナーと間抜けな状況の絶え間ない弾幕です。これは、劇場を出る前にもう一度見たいと思います。これは、初めてジョークをすべて入手できないZucker映画のようなものだからです。全部見るには、2〜3回見る必要があります。<br /> <br />実際の映画に関しては、より良い編集を使用できたかもしれませんが、時々途切れがちですが、それ。すべてのキャラクターは素晴らしいです。それは彼がおかしくなろうとするアダム・サンドラー映画のようなものではなく、他の誰もが彼の周りで苦しみ、冗談のお尻です。主人公はみんなとても好感が持てるので、今後何年も覚えておきたいと思います。この映画の犠牲者はいません。また、45歳の女優にガールフレンドを演じてもらったことを神に感謝します。キャサリン・キーナーが演じ、彼女はこの映画の恋人です。彼女のような女性が本当に存在していることを望みます。彼女は他の主要な女性のように「10」ではありませんが、どういうわけか彼女の笑顔はジュリア・ロバーツが過度にかみすぎたよりも暖かいです。私はあなたを保証します、トレーラーはそれを正しくしません。彼らはすべての良いジョークを与えるわけではありません。平凡なもののほんの一部です。<br /> <br />ああ、もう1つ。私は批評家がこれを彼らのトップ10リストに載せることを望みます。彼らの多くは、コメディーは彼らにふさわしい認識を得ておらず、年末にはリストに載せませんでしたと不満を漏らしています。これはあなたを意味します!!!
"A terrifying story about Mars' attempt to colonize the Earth. (In Mars, the situation should be pretty bad.) Two U.S. troopers report the UFO crash reported.

There is a sparkling businessman who needs to get to Boston (John Hoyt). Young couple on honeymoon. (Performance performed by husband, Ron Kipling.)

It's not a warning of any kind, it's just a fairy tale bypassing and entertaining. <br /> <br /> I always like it when it's always on. It is interesting to think that John Hoyt is an annoying and impatient businessman.

"It's rarely necessary to write a review on this site, but this film is very valuable because of how bad the production process was and how the product was biased. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers tried to make the Palestinian family look ashamed and unreliable. We heard them talking about the sadness they felt as oppression. However, the film is filmed and arranged in such a way that the politically oppressed population feels Jewish Israelis. There is no evidence similar to that of a Palestinian teenager. We can make it from other Palestinians in prison. I understand that there are restrictions, but the political nature of the restrictions is designed to prevent peace. <br /> <br /> The movie came out of the feeling that the victim's mother was sad, selfish and completely closed. Because of her side of the fence, so to speak. She did not want to continue to see the bomber's parents' wounds, and the angry and closed words made the final meeting out of control. Seeing Israel's way of thinking is the root of the problem is more realistic in my opinion. Ignoring petitions for understanding and freedom, I dismissed requests for approval of the Jewish population's process of acquiring land. <br /> <br /> Because of this mother's selfish weakness, I wrote it in two. It's admirable in the documentary, but it seems all exploitative in that it lacks fairness. There are also incorrect edits, lack of background in real cases, and finally lack of proper representation on the Palestinian side. After all, it is not good for documentaries and movies. I admit that this is partly the result of a political situation, but I have to pay attention to the flaws regardless of the offended and sad subject.","I rarely feel I need to write a review on this site, but this movie is very valuable because of how poorly made it and its product bias. <br /> <br /> I felt a definite attempt Some of the filmmakers who display the Palestinian family as poor and untrustworthy.

There is no evidence comparable to Palestinian teenagers. We only hear from other Palestinians in prison. I understand there are restrictions, but the political nature of restrictions is designed to prevent peace. <br /> <br /> The mother of the victim came out of the film feeling mourning, selfish and completely closed-mindedly because of her side of the fence.

Good in documentaries, but in the light of lack of impartiality, it all seems exploitative. The same is true of improper editing, lack of background in the actual instance, and ultimately lack of proper representation on the part of Palestine.

"Relentless like one of those loud action movies.The entire cast seems to be on speed.I didn't quite get the director's intentions if any.I wonder if she's ever seen a Stanley Donen, Vincent Minnelli or even a George Sidney musical. Structure The pleases This is one hell of a mess and I loved Abba.The costumes the unflattering photography-unflattering towards the actors but loving towards the locations) The one thing that makes the whole thing bearable is the sight of Meryl Streep making a fool of herself.No chemistry with her friends (Christine Baranski and Julie Walters) think of Streep with Lily Tomlyn in the Altman film and you'll understand what I was hoping for.I was embarrassed in particular by Pierce Brosnam and Colin Firth.The audience, however, seemed to enjoy it so it probably it's just me.","No mercy like a noisy action movie. The whole cast seems to be speeding up. I didn't understand what the director had in mind. Maybe she's seen Stanley Donen, Vincent Minnelli, or George Sydney's musical. I would like the structure!

No-frills photo costume-no-actress for actors, but loving for places) One thing that allows you to put up with everything is the sight that Meryl Streep makes a fool of. Compatibility with her friends (Kristin Balsky and Julie Walters) doesn't even think of a streak with Lily Tomlin in the Altman movie.

"In the 1950's alternative, the young alien Timmy, who included the occurrence of the undead due to the mysterious'space dust' using this special electronic ring, finds a friend in Fido (Billy Connelly). <br /> <br /> Fido quickly becomes Timmy's acting father. His dad was a son (or unable to adequately express his love for his trot wife) The gorgeous Carrie-Anne Moss was psychologically hurt as a child (when he tried to shoot and eat his father! ). <br /> <br /> Timmy jumped to the annoying point. When the collar of a corrupt friend blinks, it attacks and kills the old man. With the authorities on the trail of Fido, a couple of local bullies are struggling to brew, and if his mother has a ties to help the undead house, will Timmy be able to catch his new friend? Refreshing the entire zombie, Fido is a completely enjoyable and deliciously dark comedy that appeals to someone with a pleasant sense of humor. Bringing Romero zombie verses and transplanting them to a small town America in the 1950s is genius, and the result is one of the most original movies covering the whole'dead dead' theme I've seen. <br /> <br /> Connery's Bloody is a movie zombie that can join the tale of Dales of the Dead and the return of the living dead Tarman, taking him to the Hall of Fame in the undead movie. I don't often feel empathy for the walking corpse, but the performance of The Big Yin is so great that it turns out to actually cheer for a big blue pus pocket! The rest of the cast also features performances worth mentioning by young K'Sun Ray (Timmy) and Ms.Moss. Ray was particularly confident when he was too young, and Moss tasted bloody! <br /> <br /> This is the third zombie movie I've seen this week (others are a somewhat disappointing Plan et Terror and a rather interesting Living Of The Living Dead). It is also the best. Director Andrew Curry gave fans of the genre something unique to the treasures and had the talent to see in the future. <br /> <br /> 8.5 points out of 10, and 9 points for IMDb.","In the alternative 1950s, when a special electronic collar was used to contain the undead outbreak (due to the mysterious ""cosmic dust""), a young lonely Timmy found a friend in Fido (Billy Connelly). A domesticated zombie that the family recently acquired. <br /> <br /> Fido soon became Timmy's acting father. The father is unable to properly describe his son (or his wife's love for his wife). Gorgeous Carrie Ann Moss was psychologically hurt when he was a kid (he was shot by his father and tried to eat him!).<br /> <br />But Timmy Came across an annoying spot. The collar of his rotten companion goes in an instant and he attacks and kills his elderly neighbor. If Fido's Road authorities, brewing issues with a local bully, and his mother form a bond with the help of the Undead's house, could Timmy protect his newly found friend? <br /> <br /> A refreshing catch of the entire zombie short film, Fido is a completely fun and delicious dark comedy that can appeal to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humor. Taking Romero's zombie berth and transplanting it into the little town of America in the 1950s was a genius blow, and the result was one of the most original films I've seen to tackle the whole theme of ""Reborn Dead"". It's just one. <br /> <br /> Connelly's Fido is a movie zombie suitable for entering the Undead Movie Hall of Fame, along with Day of the Dead's Bab and Return of the Living Dead's Tarman. I don't feel much empathy for the walking corpse, but the performance of the Big In is so good that I really support the big blue bag of pus. The rest of the cast also provided brilliant performance, and young K'Sun Ray (as Timmy) and Ms. Moss deserve a special mention-Ray is very young, so he takes a particularly solid turn. But she is very bloody and delicious! <br /> <br /> This is the third zombie movie I've seen this week (the others are the slightly disappointing planetary terror and the pretty fun Flight of the Living Dead). And, surprisingly, that's great too. Andrew Currie has provided fans of this genre with something truly original and talented for the future. <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb."
"Made and acted well in the extremely thorough ""Rodeo"" West. I didn't need an asterisk here because all the casts were ordinary people telling real stories about Rodeo Hustler and his surroundings in the West of the 60s and 70s. But, especially given the fact that he was a rodeo clown in real life, I hate Slim Pickens for giving me what he thinks is his handwriting performance. His nose went beyond a simple clown role because he covered all the ""reliefs"" of rodeo life and the psychological devastation surrounding such a lifestyle too often. He and Coburn worked very well as partners not only in the circuit itself, but also in the real world outside the ranch. Also see Anne Archer as Coburn's Native American love interest for the second half of the movie. It would have been one of her first roles. <br /> <br /> Probably not as fancy as ""Junior Bonner,"" but equally affects the expression and description of the mind. Thanks to Encore Western Channel for showing the true meaning of sometimes rated movies.","Very realistic, well made and played the ""Rodeo"" Western. All the cast members were regular people talking with Rodeo Hustler about his aides in the West in the 60s and 70s, so we didn't need a boring star here. But I especially hate the Slim Pickens for giving me what I consider to be his signature performance, especially given the fact that he was a rodeo clown in real life. His role goes far beyond just the role of a clown, and he has dealt with all the ""ups and downs"" of hard nose rodeo life and the psychological devastation that often surrounds such a lifestyle. He and Mr Cobain worked very well together as partners not only on the circuit itself, but in the real world outside the enclosure. Also check out Anne Archer for Coburn's Native American love interest in the second half of the film. Must have been one of her first roles. <br /> <br /> It's not as flashy, but perhaps not as much as a ""junior Bonner,"" but it also has a heart rendering and impact in its depiction. Thanks to the Encore Western Channel, it sometimes showed us the true grit of a poorly rated movie."
"Even though some reviews are clearly Luke-warm, the story was completely interesting, and what do some critics describe the love story as'Mills and Boon'? In this cynical era, it is good to see a warm and touching story of true love. Many of the audience sniffed and stared at the eyes. You really believe that young Victoria and Albert love each other politically, even though they are passionately married. I thought desperate Sir John Conroy would probably play like a pantomime villain to control the young queen. It would have been interesting to explore this theory (because of the relationship with her mother, Duchess of Kent) that there was rumor that he was actually Victoria's real father. Emily Blunt is a young princess, completely convincing, and imprisoned by royal palaces and politicians to control her. She finally portrays the power of character and determination that made Victoria the great queen of England, which prospered during her long reign. Word of mouth recommendation is the most enjoyable and wonderful",一部のレビューは明らかにルークウォームでしたが、ストーリーは完全に夢中になり、一部の評論家がラブストーリーを「ミルズアンドブーン」と表現したとしても、何ですか？この皮肉な時代に、本当の愛の温かく感動的な物語を見るのは良いことです。聴衆の多くは、嗅ぎながら、密かに目を軽くたたいていました。若いヴィクトリアとアルバートは情熱的にお互いを愛していると信じていますが、それは政治的な理由から、結婚生活でした。若い女王を支配するために必死だったジョン・コンロイ卿はおそらくパントマイムの悪役のように演奏されているように感じました。彼が実際、ビクトリアの本当の父親であったと噂されているので（母親のケント公爵夫人との関係の結果として）、この理論を探究することは興味深いでしょう。エミリー・ブラントは幼い王女として完全に説得力があり、廷臣や政治家が彼女を操作するために外に出て窒息宮殿に閉じ込められました。彼女は、ヴィクトリアを彼女の長い統治下でかつてないほど繁栄したイングランドの偉大な女王とした最終的な性格と決意の強さを見事に描写しています。口コミの推奨事項は、この最も楽しくて見栄えの良い映画に大きな成功をもたらすと信じています。

"First, I must say that I liked the book Animal Farm. I read in 9th grade class and it was great. We also decided that it was beneficial to watch a movie. The movie was so disappointing to me. The movie cuts some characters and misses the point of the book a lot. Skip a lot and don't explain in detail. It would be confusing if someone was watching this movie without reading a book. For me, the most disappointing thing in this movie was the ending. The ending of this book was the most powerful, and it changed in the movie! It should have been a pig and a man in an alliance and some sort of ""dissolution"", but the movie seemed to be that animals were rebelling against the pig. To sum up, I don't think this film captured the true meaning that Orwell described in his book.","First of all, I must say that I liked the book ""Animal Farm"".

It would be confusing if someone who didn't read the book first was watching this movie. The ending that was most disappointing for me was the ending. The ending of the book is the strongest and they changed it in the movie! It was suspected that the men who were allied with the pigs would ""melt"" together, but instead, the movie made the animals appear to be rebelling against the pigs. In summary, I don't think this movie captured the true meaning of Orwell's book."

"Pixar의 A Bug 's Life에서 이러한 즐거운 세상이 만들어졌습니다. 우리는 영화에서 이것을 유쾌하게 문서화 할 수있는 우주에 몰입하지만,보다 정확하게는 애니메이션 세계를 통해서만 문서화 될 수있는 우주에 빠져 있습니다. 풍부하고 풍성한 세계 애니메이션이 무엇을 제공 할 수 있는지 잊어 버린 사람들에게 – 버그의 삶은 따뜻한 기억입니다. 우리는 평온한 느낌과 높은 수준의 영화 제작에서만 파생 된 만족감으로 영화를 떠납니다. <br /> <br /> 픽사의 두 번째 애니메이션 기능입니다. 디즈니의 하위 그룹은 1995 년 3 년 전에 영화계에 화려한 데뷔작이었고 아마도 전적으로 부주의 한 마크를 냈으며 랜드 마크 영화인 토이 스토리를 들었습니다. 이 영화는 관습을 무시하고 새로운 삶을 애니메이션으로 재창조하고 숨 쉬고 완전히 새로운 수준의 우수성을 정의한 영화였습니다. 이제 그들은 영화를보기 전에 솔직히 말해서 우리 모두에게 냉소 감을 불러 일으키는 2 학년의 노력으로 돌아옵니다. <br /> <br /> 결국 개미에 관한 영화입니다. 글쎄, 곤충과 벌레 세계의 모든 산책은 A Bug 's Life에 포함되어 있지만 인간은 드라마, 로맨스 등의 초점 이므로이 영화의 초점은 개미입니다. 개미와 같은 무의미한 동물 종은 어떻게 장편 영화의 전제를 제공하지는 않지만 어떻게 영화의 주인공 역할을 할 수 있습니까? 분명히 그들은 농담합니다. 그러나 우리는 Toy Story에서 많은 장난감 상자 항목이 가장 크고 영감을주고 사랑스러운 애니메이션 영웅과 악당이 될 수 있음을 잊었습니다. Pixar의 직원들은 동일한 업적을 이끌어 내고, 더럽고 작은 버그를 잔인하고 가장 사랑스럽고 즐거운 해충으로 만들 수 있습니다. <br /> <br /> 그들 모두는 전적으로 호의적이고 호의적입니다 – 불쾌한 캐릭터는 보이지 않습니다. 악당들조차도 리벳을 부리는 캐릭터들입니다. 그러나 그들은 다채롭고 절충 적이며 독특합니다. 그리고 더 나은 용어가 부족하기 때문에 문자 배열도 엄청나게 독창적입니다. 처음부터 A Bug 's Life에 이미 풍부한 풍부한 층을 추가합니다. 우리는 주인공과 영웅으로 시작할 것입니다. 그의 이름은 Flik (David Foley)이며, 그의 성격은 가장 덜 대표적입니다. 무성하고 아름다운 개미 섬에 거주하는 수천 명의 충실하고 순종적 인 일개미 중 하나는 영화의 첫 순간에 부주의하게 시즌 수확을 파괴 할 때 볼 수 있듯이 씨족의 '검은 양'으로 간주되는 사람입니다 그의 개미. <br /> <br /> 개미의 수확은 호퍼 (Kevin Spacey)가 이끄는 탐욕스러운 메뚜기 무리에 대한 것이라는 사실에서 발생한다. 작은 개미를 처벌; 그들이 연례 연회를 위해 Ant Island에 나타나서 그들의 제물이 사라진 것을 볼 때, 그들은 더 나은 용어가 없기 때문에 미쳤습니다. 호퍼는 개미의 손에서 개미를 완전히 멸종시킬 것을 제안합니다. 그러나 협상은 단순히 이행하기가 불가능합니다. Flik의 마음 속에있는 톱니 바퀴와 시계는 그의 죄책감과 수치심에도 불구하고 이제 완전히 찌르고, 식민지의 구조에 와서 호퍼와 메뚜기와 싸울 수있는 강력한 버그 전사를 찾기 위해 Ant Island를 떠나도록 제안합니다. <br / > <br /> 생각해 보면 A Bug 's Life는 구로사와 아키라의 클래식 7 사무라이의 줄거리 라인과 비슷하거나 미국의 리메이크 더 매 그니 피 슨트 7 (The Magnificent Seven)과 비슷합니다. 악의적이며 사악한 적들에 의해 – 한 고독한 마을-상인이 대도시에서 도움을 구하고 그것을 찾아 식민지로 돌아가 악을 몰아냅니다. A Bug 's Life에서는 Flik이 바룸 싸움에서 전사로 잘못 인식 한 다운 서커스 그룹의 형태로 도움을받습니다. <br /> <br />이 장면에서 많은 즐거움이 나옵니다. 이 서커스 극단 버그에서 많은 즐거움이 나옵니다. 그중에는에 루다이 트 스틱 곤충 (David Hyde Pierce), Heimlich라는 이름으로 옆구리 비만 독일 애벌레와 사실 거칠고 남성 무당 벌레 (Dennis Hopper) 인 준 여성 치명적인 무당 벌레가 있습니다. 버그 전체를보고있는 것처럼 버그와 곤충이 화면에서 상호 작용하는 것을 보면서 화면에서 이러한 버그를 보는 것이 대단히 즐겁습니다. <br /> <br /> 내가 말했듯이, 많은 즐거움과 광기가옵니다. 그들의 성격과 서로와의 즐거운 상호 작용으로 재미있는 라인, 멋진 긴장감과 리벳이 많은 상황 및 전반적으로 눈부신 영화를 제공합니다. A Bug 's Life를 더 좋게 만드는 것은 아이들이 실제로 영화에서 더 많은 엔터테인먼트를 찾을 수 있지만 많은 사람들이 그것을 인식 할 수 있기 때문에 영화는 단순히 어린이들에게만 국한되지 않는다는 것입니다. 우리는 원합니다. 그러나이 결점을 무시하기는 쉽고이 영화를 즐기기가 엄청나게 쉽습니다. <br /> <br /> 버그의 삶은 전임자가 설정 한 현기증과 획기적인 표준에 도달하지 못할 수 있지만 여전히 최고의 영화입니다. 여기에 유망한 무언가의 시작. 픽사 (Pixar)는 그들이 한 번의 경이로움이 아니라 할리우드에서 재능 있고 재능있는 영화 예술가 그룹이라는 것을 증명했습니다. 그들은 끊임없이 막대를 높이고 누군가가 항상 자신의 표준을 준수 할 때 항상 혼자 있습니다. A Bug 's Life에 대해 더 말할 것이 있습니까? 우리가 캘리포니아 에머리 빌의 사람들에게서 본 것 중 최고는 아니지만, 올해의 많은 부분을 능가합니다. 1998 년 최고의 애니메이션 기능이 아니라면 저주받을 것입니다. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10",このような楽しい世界は、ピクサーの「バグズライフ」で私たちのために作成されました。私たちは、これを映画で楽しく記録できるだけの宇宙に浸っていますが、より正確には、アニメーションの世界を通してしか記録できない宇宙にいます。豊かで活気に満ちた世界のアニメーションが何を提供できるかを忘れてしまった人たちにとって–それが右手にあるとき–バグの人生は暖かい思い出です。私たちは、同じように温かい感じと、高品質の映画制作だけの満足感の派生物をもって、映画の外に出ます。<br /> <br />これは、ピクサーの2番目のアニメーション機能にすぎません。ディズニーのサブグループは、画期的なデビューを果たし、1995年に3年前に画期的な映画「トイストーリー」で映画の世界にまったく不注意なマークを付けました。それは、慣習に逆らい、アニメーションに新しい命を吹き込み、新しい生命を吹き込み、まったく新しいレベルの卓越性を定義した映画でした。今、彼らは二年生の努力で戻ってきて、正直に言うと、映画を見る前に私たち全員にシニシズムの忍び寄る感覚を引き出します。<br /> <br />結局のところ、それはアリについての映画です。まあ、虫と虫の世界の散歩はすべてバグズライフで取り上げられていますが、人間がドラマやロマンスなどの焦点であるので、この映画の焦点はアリです。アリなどの重要でない動物種が映画の主人公として機能することはもちろん、長編映画の前提全体を提供することはできますか？確かに彼らは冗談を言う。ただし、トイストーリーでは、たくさんのおもちゃ箱のアイテムが、これまでに作られた最も壮大で最も刺激的で愛らしいアニメーションのヒーローや悪役のグループになることができなかったことを忘れています。ピクサーの連中は同じ偉業を成し遂げ、汚くて小さなバグの束を、おそらくこれまでに遭遇するであろう最も可愛くて楽しい害虫の集団に変えることに成功した。<br /> <br />だけではないそれらはすべて完全に愛想がよく、好感が持てます–不快な性格は見えません。悪役でさえリベッティングキャラクターですが、彼らはカラフルで、折衷的で、特異的です。そして、文字の配列も、より良い用語がないために巨大であり、最初からすでにバグズライフに組み込まれている独特の豊かな層を追加するだけです。私たちの主人公とヒーローから始めましょう。彼の名前はFlik（David Foley）で、彼の性格は控えめに言ってもかなり一般的です。緑豊かで美しいアント島に住む何千もの忠実で従順な働きアリの中で、彼は一族の「黒い羊」と見なされているアリです。映画の冒頭の瞬間に見られるように、シーズンの収穫を誤って破壊しました。彼のふざけた態度。<br /> <br />問題は、アリの収穫がホッパー（ケビンスペイシー）が率いる貪欲なバッタの束のためであるという事実で発生します。ホッパー（ケビンスペイシー）は、彼らの間で彼らの怒りと独裁を主張し続けたいと熱望しています。ちっぽけな小さなアリ;彼らが毎年恒例の宴会のためにアントアイランドにやって来て、彼らの供え物がなくなったことに気づいたとき、彼らはより良い言葉の欠如のために正気を失っています。ホッパーは彼のパックの手でアリを完全な絶滅から救う命題を提供しています。しかし、それは交渉を遂行するだけでは不可能です。 Flikの心の中の歯車と時計仕掛けは、罪悪感と恥ずかしさにもかかわらず、今、全力で動いています。彼は、コロニーの救出に来てホッパーとバッタと戦うことができる強力なバグの戦士を探してアント島を離れることを提案します。<br / > <br />考えてみれば、A Bug's Lifeは、黒澤明の古典的なセブンサムライのプロットライン、またはアメリカのリメイクThe Magnificent Sevenに酷似しています。そこでは、不幸ではあるが心のこもった人々の村が脅かされています。悪意のある邪悪な敵によって– 1人の孤独な村に住む人が大都会で助けを求めて探しに行き、それを見つけてコロニーに戻り、悪を追い払います。 A Bug's Lifeでは、ヘルプは、Flikが居酒屋の喧嘩の戦士と誤って認識しているダウンとアウトのサーカス団の形で提供されます。<br /> <br />これらのシーンから多くの娯楽が生まれます。 、そしてこれらのサーカス団のバグから多くの娯楽が生まれます。その中には、エルディテスティック昆虫（David Hyde Pierce）、ハイムリックの名前の横割りの肥満のドイツキャタピラー、そして実際にはザラザラで男性的なてんとう虫（Dennis Hopper）がいる、疑似フェムの致命的なてんとう虫があります。映画全体と同様に、バグや昆虫が画面上で相互作用しているので、これらのバグを画面上で見るのは非常に楽しいです。<br /> <br />すでに述べたように、多くの娯楽と不思議がやって来ます。彼らのキャラクターとお互いの楽しい相互作用から、陽気なライン、素晴らしくサスペンス的でリベッティングな状況、そして全体的にまばゆい映画に変わります。 A Bug's Lifeをさらに良くするのは、多くの人がそれを理解しているように、映画が子供たちだけに制限されていないということです。ただし、子供たちはこの映画から実際により多くの娯楽を見つけます。独り言の子供向けの状況は、お願いします。ただし、この欠点を無視するのは簡単であり、この映画を信じられないほど簡単に楽しむこともできます。<br /> <br />バグの人生は、前任者が設定した目がくらむような画期的な基準に達しないかもしれませんが、これはまだ素晴らしい映画です、そしてここで有望な何かの始まり。ピクサーは、彼らがワンヒットの不思議なだけでなく、ハリウッドの才能豊かで才能のある映画アーティストのグループであることを証明しました。彼らは無限にレベルを上げます、そして誰かがいつも彼らの基準を上手に管理することができるとき、それは常に彼ら自身だけです。 A Bug's Lifeについて、他に何が言えるでしょうか。カリフォルニアのエメリービルの人々から見たものとしては最高ではありませんが、これはその年の多くを打ち負かしています–そして、これが1998年の最高のアニメーション機能でなければ、私はとんでもないことになります。<br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
"Vacant and shiny expression of a classic novel. I hope people get messed up with the classics when they don't clearly know the actual intentions or gist of the original. This version is no different. Though the casting of Juliette brioche like Kathy was the worst casting decision, I thought the Ralph Fiennes version was much worse. It aims to relate the story to the modern environment and musical style. It all succeeds in art, but it is nit. The terrible city hall on a rainy day maybe .. The direction was plain and the editing was terrible. Worse than the old Quincy Deepak Verma went through a big change like Hindley, and in fact one of the British wasted talent. Part of Heath was played with great charm and faith and I think casting is the biggest point of this project. The more talented director would have made better use of his facilities. It is clear that he was a hiring director and did not instill a valuable passion in the project.",古典小説の空虚で光沢のない演出。オリジナルの本当の意図やポイントが明確にわからない場合は、クラシックをいじるのをやめてほしいと思います。このバージョンも同じです。キャシーとしてのジュリエットブリオッシュのキャスティングはこれまでで最悪のキャスティングの決定であるはずなのに、とにかくこのバージョンに戻るとはいえ、ラルフファインズバージョンははるかに悪いと感じました。それは物語を現代的な設定に関連し、音楽的なスタイルにすることを目的としています。それは両方で成功しますが、それは高い芸術です。雨の日のための使い捨ての視聴かもしれません...方向は平均的で編集はひどいものでした。古いクインシーよりも悪い。ディーパックヴェルマはヒンドリーとして素晴らしい方向を向いており、実はイギリスの才能を無駄にしています。ヒース役は魅力と信念が込められていて、キャスティングがこのプロジェクトの最大のポイントだと思います。もっと才能のある監督なら、彼が持っていた設備をよりよく活用できただろうが。彼が採用担当ディレクターであり、それにふさわしい情熱をプロジェクトに植え付けなかったことは明らかです。

"It's amazing to be made for a television like this one, especially for television. Given the strong sexual themes and explicit sex scenes, not to mention lesbian sex, it is given great treatment and direction. <br /> <br /> The set and costumes are perfect, the direction is refined and the character is good. There is a fair amount of humor, but surprisingly there is a dark gap. The main character is actually tragic, but without happiness. Also, this work avoids the mistakes most movies/shows make when dealing with homosexual/lesbianism. The character is very human. To make it easier for people to watch gays and lesbians on TV and watch them comfortably, most shows fill it with clichés and make the characters obsessed with being gay. It's not like that. In the velvet tip, the protagonist knows little about what lesbians mean! <br /> <br /> The BBC has made great work in the past, and this adventurous work sets the standard for excellence in every way.","It's amazing that these kinds of productions have recently been made specifically for television.

"I just don't get some of the big buildings in this episode. Miranda is so amazing and so ugly that it will drive you crazy. Someone here said something about the frequency of light or something that is not ugly. Miranda is just a fool. Episodes are slow, inconsistent, and too flashy. I also don't understand why Kolos is an ambassador. Why won't the Federation leave Medusa Mountain? Here's what I like when Kolos talks about the loneliness of the human experience through Spock. Overall, I like TOS and I will always tune it even in the smallest case-this episode -. Well, I won't buy it except for used copies under $3.","I don't get some of the big premise of this episode-Miranda is very noteworthy and that there is anything ugly that you go crazy.

"This is one of my favorite movies and I recommend it to anyone.

Romance was so cute that it didn't make an intense tooooo difficult! It was a humanitarian factor that actually made it. Jess's parents are Indian, and there are many colorful Indian conventions that offer everything from movies to very interesting cultural insights as well as everything else. Indian people are also fun!

"This animation has a very simple and simple plot of good and evil and is about action. The difference from other animations is how well human movements animate. It was really beautiful to see the running woman running from left to right on the screen. Why aren't you using this rotoscopic technique more recently? It is very effective. <br /> <br /> Fire and Ice is definitely committed to showing the beautiful dam in trouble in a variety of sexy ways in prehistoric settings and in almost undressed women. Some hate this and can be considered another moronic male's sexual fantasies, while others (including many) will love the aesthetic quality. I wasn't sure! Bakshi loves to animate a lush and voluptuous lady, as you can see in Cool World. I don't think he should be angry because it's an animation for adults. However, I also enjoyed this animation as a child and never forgot. <br /> <br /> This film is worth it since it is very different from the standard Disney or Anime fare. Probably the best of Park Si. For those who like the anime of lush women, try Space Adventure Cobra.",このアニメーションは、非常にシンプルで簡単な善対悪のプロットであり、すべてアクションに関するものです。他のアニメーションとの違いは、人間の動きがどれだけうまくアニメーション化されているかです。逃げる女が画面を左から右へ走り回って周りを見回す姿は本当に美しく、動きもよくできていました。最近、なぜ彼らはこのロトスコープ技術を使わないのでしょうか？それは非常に効果的です。<br /> <br /> Fire and Iceは、先史時代の設定でほとんど服を着ていない女性の中で、さまざまなセクシーな方法で美しい乙女を苦痛に見せることに専念しました。一部の人はこれを嫌い、それをさらにもう1つの男性的な性的幻想と見なし、他の人（多くの女性を含む）はそれが審美的であることを崇拝します。私は確かに気にしませんでした！クールワールドでも見られるように、バクシは豊かで官能的なベイビーをアニメーション化するのが大好きです。大人向けのアニメーションがほとんどなので、彼を規制する必要はないと思います。しかし、私は子供としてもこのアニメーションを楽しんでいたので、決して忘れませんでした。<br /> <br />これは特別なもので、標準のディズニーやアニメの運賃とは異なり、その理由だけで見る価値はありますそれはおそらくBakshiの最高です。豪華な女性とのアニメーションが好きな方は、スペースアドベンチャーコブラも試してください。<br /> <br /> 10点満点で8点の火と氷をあげます。

"First, let me tell you what I liked about the movie. The special effects were fantastic and didn't seem to be watching a video game. There is one last thing I have to say about this movie. In fact, I would like to note that not everyone who reads this post can swear and can't say how difficult it is to write this review. <br /> <br /> There are numerous complaints about the movie, but four main complaints come to mind. My first major complaint is related to the surprising cheese sound of ""Plot Twist"" where Lois' 5 year old son turned out to be super power. Superman's child. When the crying super kid threw the piano at Lex's father and saved his mother, I almost got up and left the theater. The singer could make a much better Superman movie without relying on cheap special effects like an illegal kid who looks fragile but has a strong latent power. Five days have passed since I watched the movie, but I still want to vomit. <br /> <br /> The next major complaint relates to the fact that Superman lifts a continent made of kryptonite into space. The Simpson cartoonists don't point out the problem. I don't know how many comic books Brian Singer read, but when Superman is exposed to a small amount of kryptonite, he has little power to stay on his feet. No one who has the idea of ​​flying to the big island that made his biggest weakness into space has nothing to do with Superman related projects. It's as ridiculous as a title character making a Dracula movie with a pile through his mind and still flying a spacecraft made of garlic into the sun. Why should Superman eat kryptonite? He eats it, brushes his teeth, then wears a kryptonite pajamas to sleep. It is no longer outrageous to bring the Kryptonite continent into space and then come back in or the entire central park does not hit the ground and does not scatter and fall helplessly through the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> My third major complaint is related to the fact that the singer is hitting a movie spectator across the face with religious symbols throughout the film. As the only son of God-like Joel sent to Earth to be a savior, I must have a problem with his characterization of Superman. Joel is not everything wise, he is just a scientist. He threw his son into the rocket without sending him to the savior and hurriedly launched into space because the planet was about to explode. If Brian Singer tried to explode in the sky and showed a part of the Bible that God sent Christ to Earth, radioactive sky fragments would be Christ's fable if Christ's main weakness was. Also, the ""Cross"" scene where Luthor pokes Superman on the side with a kryptonite ""spear"" wants me to notice my shameless and inappropriate symbolism by hitting my face with a brick until it's too dead. It pollutes people of steel for the near future. They could even change the name of this film to ""Superman Returns: The Passion of Christ"" <br /> <br /> Speaking of Luthor, my last major complaint is related to the singer's description of Lex Luthor Lex Luthor is a cool, cold-hearted business tycoon who is easier to run for the president than trying to destroy the world. The man wants money and strength. He wants to take responsibility for ruining everything. But Superman Returns and all the previous Superman movies are gateways to the wrong play that presents a terrible plan to destroy the world. If the singer had some loyalty to the characters instead of the previous Superman movie, this movie may not be an unbearable tragedy. Perhaps the singer's next project might be a Batman movie that focused on Batman's interpretation on a 1960s TV show. slumbers! !! POW !! <br /> <br /> In short, it seems that what I hate, the movie itself, or many people are getting good reviews. Everyone has the right to their opinion, but your opinion is wrong unless you hate this movie. If you haven't read this, I hope you haven't seen this movie yet. Don't look at it, don't buy it when it comes to DVD, don't rent it. Basically don't donate money in any way. This movie does not deserve money. In fact, I think Bryan Singer should be fined $45 billion for everyone watching this movie. If you're a Superman fan and want to watch this movie, bend and let someone kick the ball, you can have the same experience without wasting 2 hours.",まず、この映画の好きなところについてコメントさせてください。特殊効果は素晴らしかった、そしてビデオゲームを見ているように感じることはほとんどなかった。そこで、それがこの映画について私が言わなければならない最後の素晴らしいことです。実際、私はこれを読んでいるすべての人に、私が悪口を言わずにこのレビューを書くのがどれほど大変であったかを言葉でさえ言えないことに注意してもらいたいと思います。 <br /> <br />私は映画について無数の不満を持っていますが、4つの主要な不満が思い浮かびます。私の最初の主な不満は、「プロットのひねり」の信じられないほどの安っぽさに関するものです（ほとんどの人はおそらく1マイル離れたところにそれを見たのでそれを呼ぶことができます）。そこで、ロイスの5歳の息子は超能力であることが判明しましたスーパーマンの子。泣いているスーパーチャイルドが母親を救うためにレックスのヘンチマンにピアノを投げたとき、私はほとんど起き上がって劇場を去りました。歌手は、一見壊れやすいように見えるが潜在的に超能力のある非合法的な子供のような安価な仕掛けに頼らずに、はるかに優れたスーパーマン映画を作ることができたでしょう。映画を見てから5日経ちましたが、今でも吐きたいです。 <br /> <br />私の次の主な不満は、スーパーマンがクリプトナイトから作られた大陸を宇宙空間に持ち上げているという事実に関係しています。シンプソンズのコミックブックの男がそれの何が悪いのかを指摘することはありません。ブライアンシンガーが何冊の漫画本を読んだかはわかりませんが、スーパーマンが少量のクリプトナイトにさらされただけでは、足に留まる力がほとんどありません。彼の最大の弱点から作られた大きな島を宇宙に飛ばすという考えを持っている人は誰でも、スーパーマン関連のプロジェクトに関連するビジネスは二度とありません。コンセプトは、タイトルキャラクターが心を揺さぶられ、ニンニクで作られた宇宙船を太陽に向けて飛ばすドラキュラ映画を作るのと同じくらいばかげています。スーパーマンにクリプトナイトを食べさせてみませんか？彼はそれを食べてから歯を磨き、その後クリプトナイトのパジャマで寝ることができます。彼が大陸にクリプトナイトを吊り上げ、その後、再突入で燃え尽きたり、中央公園全体に飛び散ったりせずに地面に飛び散ることなく、無力で大気中に落下することは、もはや不合理ではありません。 <br /> <br />私の3番目の主な不満は、歌手が映画全体を宗教的な象徴で顔を横切って平手打ちするという事実に関係しています。スーパーマンが救世主になるために地球に送られた神のようなヨレルの唯一の息子であるという彼の特徴付けに問題を抱えている。ジョエルは賢明ではなく、単なる科学者でした。そして彼は救世主になるために息子を地球に送らず、彼の惑星が爆発しようとしていたので、彼をロケットに投げ入れて急いで宇宙に発砲しました。ブライアンシンガーが天国が爆発しようとしていたために神が地球にキリストを送った聖書の一部を私に示すことができれば、キリストの寓話を購入します。さらに、ルトールがスーパーマンをクリプトナイトの「槍」で横に突き刺す「はりつけ」のシーンは、頭が死にすぎて、ずば抜けて明白で不適切な象徴に気付くまで、顔をレンガに叩きつけたくなるだけです。予見可能な未来のために鋼の男を汚す。彼らはこの映画の名前を「スーパーマンリターンズ：キリストの受難」に改名することもできます。<br /> <br />そして、ルトールといえば、私の最後の大きな不満は、シンガーによるレックスルトールの描写に関係しています。 Lex Luthorは、世界を破壊しようとするよりも大統領（漫画ではそうする）に立候補する傾向がある、抜け目がなく冷酷なビジネス界の大物です。男はお金と力を望んでいる。彼はすべてを台無しにするのではなく、担当したいと考えています。それでも、スーパーマンリターンズやこれまでのすべてのスーパーマンムービーと同じルトールは、世界を破壊するための奇妙な計画を思いついた奇抜な演劇です。以前のスーパーマン映画（かなりひどい）の代わりに、シンガーが登場人物に少しでも忠誠を持っていたとしたら、この映画はそれほど耐え難いものではないかもしれません。多分、シンガーの次のプロジェクトはバットマン映画で、1960年代のテレビ番組からのバットマンの解釈に焦点を当てています。 ZAM！ WHAP！捕虜!! <br /> <br />要約すると、私は何がもっと嫌いなのか、映画自体、または非常に多くの人々が良いレビューを与えているように見えるという事実を知りません。誰もが彼らの意見を受け取る権利がありますが、この映画が嫌いでなければあなたの意見は間違っています。これを読んだ人は、まだこの映画を見ないようにしてください。それを見ないでください、それがDVDで出てきたときにそれを買ってはいけません、それをレンタルしないでください...基本的に、それに何らかのお金を寄付しないでください。この映画はお金を稼ぐに値しない。実際、この映画を見るすべての人にとって、ブライアンシンガーは450億ドルの罰金を科されるべきだと思います。スーパーマンのファンで、この映画を本当に見たい場合は、腰をかがめて、誰かにボールを蹴られれば、2時間の時間を無駄にすることなく、同じ体験をすることができます。
"This is one of the best TV productions of a musical. I watched the Merman cast album, Angela Lansbury album, Tyne Daly live, and watched the Rosalind Russell movie several times. I think Bette is connected with the best if not the best. She captures not only bravura, but also Mama Rose's pathos. I was never a Natalie Wood fan, so I really enjoyed Cynthia Gibb. Everything from costumes to sets to auxiliary performances is great. The three strippers led by Christine Ebersole, which you can always rely on, are hard to go. Along with Cher, there was a TV production of Mame a few years ago.","It's one of the greatest television shows in musical history. I've seen many Merman cast albums, Angela Lansbury albums, Tyne Daly live, Rosalind Russell movies. I think betting is the best, if not the best. She captures not only dangle, but the pity of Mama Rose. I wasn't a fan of Natalie Wood, so I definitely enjoyed her best role, Cynthia Gibb. From costumes to sets to supporting performances, everything is great. The three strippers, led by Christine Ebersole, who are always on the go, are hard to reach the top. There should have been a bean TV show with Cher a few years ago, but I think betting is the best bet for Anti Mame."
"I'm sorry that this movie is actually bad. It reminds me of a c-class porn movie with one big difference: no porn. <br /> <br /> Stories and conversations require a complete check. Perhaps bad behavior was not noticeable. At a minimum, budget spending should have increased. <br /> <br /> Accepting the fact that the budget was low, the director visually sent that he had few resources, but had to spend more on talk time or better yet, others could write it can. Most of the action scenes were pointless. <br /> <br /> It was a complete waste of my time.","I'm sorry to say that this movie is really bad. It reminds me of a c-grade porn movie, but there is one big difference: there is no porn. Maybe then the bad acting wouldn't have been so noticeable. At least, pacing should have improved. <br /> <br /> I admit that the director was doing a visually good job, given his limited budget and the manager has less resources, but he should have spent more So if it's time or more for the story, ask someone to write it. Many action scenes were meaningless. <br /> <br /> It was a complete waste of my time."
"Is it a perfect movie? no. Strange adaptations in science fiction books, space, naked beauties, vampires of British efficiency appear. <br /> <br /> When I first saw this movie, I was young and all I could do. I remember the awe of the movie and Mathilda May. In fact, if this gorgeous woman didn't make the whole movie naked, it's probably not that high rating, but perhaps given her grandeur, I'm actually considering voting for it! <br /> <br / Luckily I reminded myself of the movie and watched it again now. Imagine that the pirates of the Lost Ark or the Poltergeist special effects are scattered in a rather sci-fi story, but fully imagine the best performance. I still enjoyed the movie enormously (with Matilda May), but it's nostalgic compared to today's junk movie and actually I want more at the end of the movie <br /> <br /> Bottom:. If you are a sci-fi fan who cannot miss this movie. Oh, and Mathilda May mentions young, beautiful and naked 햙",それは完璧な映画ですか？いいえ、それはSFの本からの奇妙な改作であり、それは宇宙からの吸血鬼、裸の美しさ、そしてイギリス軍の効率を特徴としています。映画とマチルダ・メイに対する畏敬の念を覚えています。実際、このゴージャスな女性が映画全体を裸にしていなかったら、おそらくそれほど高く評価しなかったでしょうが、彼女の純粋さを考えれば、私は実際に投票することを検討しています！<br /> <br / >幸運なことに私は映画を思い出し、今それをもう一度見ました。 Raiders of the Lost Arkまたはポルターガイストの特殊効果がかなりまともなSFストーリーに飛び散ったが、完全にトップのパフォーマンスを超えていると想像してください。私は今でも（マチルダメイと同様に）映画を非常に楽しんでいましたが、それはノスタルジアの混合であり、彼らが今日作ったくだらない映画と比較して、実際に終わったときにもっと欲しがっていました。<br /> <br />結論：あなたはこの映画を見逃してはいけないSFファンです。ああ、私はマチルダ・メイが若くて美しく、裸であることを言ったか？
"Overall, I was impressed by the pilot. The first 15 minutes were anxious because the creators thought they were trying to create a science fiction version of OC, but when the terrorist event happened, this fear is corrected and leads to a theme and situation rarely seen from here. Television tackle. <br /> <br /> The BSG covered topics such as monotheism, existentialism, reality, death, and terrorism, but it was primarily a sub-text, and can be contemplated or ignored by viewers if desired. On the other hand, this theme is the focus of the show and I was amazed at how well I personally discussed the topic and brought in works like Ghost In The Shell and The Matrix as reference points. If you're a fan of the two movies or other movie/television shows you just mentioned that cover the topics I mentioned, I think you'll find something here, at least. <br /> <br /> The starting point for explaining what the situation we know at BSG looks like I think they did it in a very interesting way. In particular, they liked how Cylon's belief in one God came from and how Caprica's creation was sufficiently advanced and modern. It's a technology that can be seen in the future, but as a viewer, it doesn't completely alienate us. <br /> <br /> The only weakness I found was the relationship between the Graystone parents and the actress acting'Lacy Rand'. Eric Stoltz and Paula Malcomson are individually good. However, although their scenes seemed to lack chemistry, at this point it may simply be difficult to develop a character, but this is what I think I need. I also found that Magda Apanowicz was not convincing in her role. This may fall back to the time required for experience and development, but throughout the episode her acting seemed to be forced. <br /> <br /> Based on the pilot, I look forward to seeing where'Caprica' is. BSG once","Overall I was quite impressed with the pilot. I was worried for the first 15 minutes.

At the moment it may just be in the development of the character, but I think this is something I need to work on. It turns out that Magda Apanowitz is also unconvinced of her role. This too may take some time to experience and develop, but throughout the episode her acting was forced and seemed completely unconfident. <br /> <br /> Based on the pilot, I look forward to where the ""Caprica"" ​​will go, and hopefully in the future, and hopefully to see the greatness BSG once did."
"I'm a guy who loves hoodies from New Jack City to Baby Boy, Killa Season, and B to Hollywood. However, this film was different. I am not hateful and this movie was a little fun. But a little bit was strange. Hot Boyz's (Quick Boyz's) Silkk The Shockers performance and the new Jack and SVU's (Shot's) Ice-T did not perform well. Scene of the Fall (Ice-T) trying to kill someone who wants to be a Jamaican friend He's lighting himself up in a fire that says something and burns both Ice-T and other friends. In the movie Urban Menace (a movie starring both of these actors), the Snoops character is supernatural, but after that there is no suggestion that Corrupt is evil. MJ (Silkk) struggles the first time he stings, but after that he fights normally and gets stabbed along with his thighs. When MJ confessed to killing the police, the police were harassing friend Benny. Benny has not been featured in the film, and the scene is not in the film. It is why corruption wants to kill MJ, but in fact it is still scratching the head. Wendy Jody writes a letter to Miss Jones character to explain what happened to them. This film showed the horror and poverty of the slums. The word that widened the lives of Latinos and blacks was a good part of the movie, although the clips in the movie were reused thousands of times. And the scene where Miles crashed his bike at full speed (without wearing a helmet) and crashed into a Latino brother's car and killed the Latino brother will kill him. The film was similar to the movie Urban Menace, and half of the actors were in all of these films, not just the production team. Fine. But in poverty I like the hoodie movie, but if I don't like it I don't see it. What can save me from going out is to remind me of my love for the first movie and genre made of 100 dollars. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel Purez","I'm the type of person who loves food movies from Newjack City to Baby Boy, Kira Season, B-grade to Hollywood. But this movie was something different. I don't hate this movie and it was a little fun. But some bits were just weird.

A scene where Corrupt (Ice-T) kills a man who wants to be Jamaica He says something and illuminates the fire that burns both Ice-T and the other man, which kills Jamaica, but Ice- T is unscathed and very similar to others in Ice The movie Urban Menace (starring both of these actors) was a Snoops character, but supernatural, but after this Corrupt seems to be a demon.

When MJ confessed to murdering a policeman, he struck his friend Benny and was weird. Benny was not featured in this movie and the scene is not included in the movie. The emphasis is on the fact that Corrupt wants to kill MJ, but still annoys your head. Wen Jody wrote a letter to Miss Jones's character to explain what happened in the postscript and did not mention the other two protagonists, MJ and Lisa. The film showed ghetto fear and poverty. The words that plague Latin and black words widely were a large part of the movie, despite the project's clips being reused thousands of times.

"I am a huge fan of Farcry Game, a huge fan. It's still taking place in my top 10 games list! The storyline was new and fresh... a really great foundation based on a movie... or I thought so... <br /> <br /> I think the movie is more than trying to cash in with other directors I've been in a successful game franchise. (See Doom: The Movie, and more...) <. br /> <br /> The video game begins when the player (Jack Carver) wakes up in the sea cave after being kicked out of his cave, a role-playing boat of unknown soldiers. Jack (Harlan Doyle) finds a communication device that guides him across this island, wreck, jungle, facilities and VOLCANOES and his <br /> <br /> movies are played in a very different way 1 (Lady Friends?): . There's an unnecessary 30 minutes (1/3 of the movie) called ""Bag. Story"" before reaching the ""Bomb Detonation"" scene 2: Jack then walks to the beach, kills some goons, then drives the car out... There is no such thing as a game... 3: There is no conversation with Doyle at the other end... 4:. There was no Albino with'fixed soldiers' singlet... and no mutated'monkey like' creatures jumping out of the forest Part of the Farcry game I enjoyed learning. .. 5:. Beach scenes full of sun, aircraft carriers, no communication stations on huge cliffs, no small references to in-game content (characters/items/vehicles) actually won't try to follow the storyline 6: of the game. The peak volcano scene has been replaced by an old industrial building 7:! There is an ending scene ... where everyone except Krieger can live happily ... what to do <br /> <br /> It is better to avoid this movie! If you are a gamer, this movie will hate all your souls. This movie is for a man, the girls are far away. So if a 12-29 year old man has never played Farcry, and the director is not disgusted by the attempt to port the book/game to the cinema... and this is for you...",私はFarcry Gameの大ファンで、巨大なファンです。それは私の史上トップ10のゲームリストでまだ場所を保持しています！ストーリーラインは新しく、新鮮でした...映画のベースとなる本当に素晴らしい基盤...と私は思いました... <br /> <br /> Farcry the Movieは、他の監督が現金化を試みているにすぎません。成功したゲームフランチャイズ（「Doom：The Movie」などを参照）。<br /> <br />ビデオゲームは、プレイヤー（ジャックカーバー）が撃たれた後、海側の洞窟で目覚めると始まります。未知の兵士からのRPGによるボート。次にジャックは、（ハーランドイル）が島、難破船、ジャングル、インスタレーション、火山を横断して彼を案内する通信デバイスを見つけ、彼の（女友達？）（ヴァレリーコンスタンティン）、変異した超兵士、および遺伝的に強化された動物と戦うすべてのワイルを見つけます。 <br /> <br />映画の再生は非常に異なります。1：「ボートの爆破」シーンに到達する前に、「バックストーリー」の30分（映画の1/3）が不要になります。 2：ジャックはその後、ビーチに歩いて行き、いくつかのグーンを殺し、車を追い出します...ゲームのようなものはありません... 3：反対側にドイルとのコミュニケーターはありません... 4：「改造された兵士」は一重項が付いたアルビノ...そして、茂みから飛び出す変異した「猿のような」生き物はありませんでした。 Farcryゲームの一部を楽しんで割り当てました... 5：太陽に満ちたビーチのシーン、空母、巨大な崖の上の通信局、ゲーム内のコンテンツ（キャラクター/アイテム/乗り物）への小さな参照はありません。ストーリーラインをたどる試みはまったくありません。 6：ゲームのクライマックスボルケーノシーンは、古い工業用建物に置き換えられます。 7：エンディングシーンがあります...誰もが（クリーガーを除く）誰もが幸せに暮らせる場所です...何です！<br /> <br />私はこの映画を絶対に避けることをお勧めします！あなたがゲーマーであるなら、あなたはこの映画があなたの魂すべてを憎むでしょう。それは明らかに男性を対象としているため、女の子は近づかないでください。12〜29歳の男性がFarcryをプレイしたことがなく、映画や映画を本やゲームに移植する監督の試みにうんざりしていなければ、 ...そして、これはあなたのためです...
"It is one of the best ensemble movies I have ever seen. Not much on the plot but it's amazing. You have seen the character change too subtly. The influence and love of rental villas in Italy.

"Today I wrote this review in anger at Uwe Boll and Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Hollywood produced the movie based on the darkest day in our country. 911 changed everything. Security awareness has changed. It changed our understanding of human and human evil. Most importantly and devastatingly, it changed the world. However, I am inattentive and blatantly ignorant of pursuing the interests of a completely repelled, disillusioned and angry Hollywood. In death and destruction. The film and the film are bound to be debated by word of mouth among moviegoers and critics. The most obvious one is echoed by the mainstream press. Hollywood sank to a new low. It is much lower than a lowly child who committed savage and brutal cruelty. Behind that is Uwe Boll. I am very angry with this movie. How do they disregard lost family memories? How do you dare to live the lives of brave men and women who risk their lives to save those trapped in the Tower of Destiny on an infamous day of fate?!?!? How do they challenge the satire in the mists of the world after mourning and tired 911 and at the same time try to exploit the national tragedy? !?!?!? How... dare... them <br /> <br /> To those with bile who want to see this morally terrible tragedy, I say this with a heavy heart with all my power: Remember. Go back to that day and ask yourself if you are a sane and moral person. Go back to that day and ask yourself the shame and disgrace of this film's lost life that day. Recall that day with the cry of a loved one. Recall the life lost in those two planes. Think of more massacres following the attack. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself if you have a soul. <br /> <br /> Please think. Come up with Respect the memories of life lost in 911 by not seeing this movie at all.","Today I wrote this review in anger at Uwebol and Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Hollywood made a film based on one of the darkest days of our country. 911 changed everything. It has changed our perception of security. It has changed our understanding of human and human evil. Most importantly and catastrophically, it changed our world. <br /> <br /> But I can't stress how much Hollywood is repulsed, disillusioned, and angry by the careless and explicit ignorance of trying to make a detrimental profit. From death and destruction. This and similar films create controversy in the word of mouth among movie fans and critics. Most certainly echoed by mainstream news outlets. Hollywood sank to new lows. Even lower than the cowardly bastard who committed the most barbaric and barbarous acts of brutality. Uwe Boll is behind it. I am very angry with this movie.

"There is no denying that it has an affinity for speed. That's why movies like Fast and the Furious, Dhoom and Rempit are made to satisfy audiences, especially local ones. We live on a small island, but because of the relative efficiency of the public transportation system, we don't understand why most people want to own their own wheels, which are 100% taxable when they arrive on the shore. Numerous taxes and bills to be paid when operating. Not only that, the high-end sports car was once filled by prominent politicians in the north, so it wouldn't hit the fourth gear to avoid reaching the sea. <br /> <br /> This movie is relatively easy to make. Hot Wheels and Hot Chick always go down well, aiming for the necessary demographics. One day, when the neckline revealing a non-sticky chest and short skirt that emphasizes a 2m long leg plunges, exotic cars can't pay attention to the beautiful curves of the movie. Of course, there are those who portray women as sexual objects as simple sexual objects (otherwise explain why there is a model's truck load at the motor show, but when they get four wheelers on the screen, they're gearing up without doing anything exactly). There's no guarantee of a collective orgasm sigh even when put in. The man sitting next to me swears to wear pants every time the car of dreams comes up and creams them up when I hear a roaring engine moan.<br /> <br /> Fan boys who started driving to see the latest cool cars featured in the movie.With Fast and Furious franchises, Japanese models like Evos and Skylines are just as central to the GT, where the Ford GT looks surprisingly gloomy. Carry out the fix.I was impressed with the latest models like Ferrari Enzos, Porsche Carrera GT, Konigsegg CCX and all cars with wings for the door, but seriously, my mind would be mercilessly wrecked for entertainment. Every time I go to the car, I mean, this is a perfectly fine high-performance model at the top of the car, but it does so because anyone who paid for the movie can do it because it can blow up millions.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There's no story in /> Red Line, collecting and excusing movies (ie cars) full of beauty that could tear the runway in the most boring way, excuses and hits common pedal shots (always accelerator, think of you, knock on the brakes) ) Pedals are best suited for blasphemy, and don't respect you.), steering wheel, gear shift (always move up and down, not down). All this, the actor pretends to be the worst ass using the engine, growling and other dirty looks. It's not a big order for an actor, so that's why we perform the most miserable performances in the same lines as elementary school students wrote. <br /> <br /> The heroine (yes, for girls, Natasha (a very plastic-shaped Nadia Bjorlin)) is one of the millions of discoveries-a girl with a model does not fall to 4 and is immersed in oil, she She's racing the lineage, and has influenced rock band songs (with all the lines related to cars, singing songs about love, gear shafts, lubricant moves, rides, etc.) with lyrics that just rock laughs. The gangster (Eddie Griffin) faces a desire to have an illegal race and falls into a family problem related to an Iraq war veteran similar to Leo DiCaprio and some ridiculous, colorful and rich man, as I said.

"I am the type of person who always rides 2 in horror when choosing a movie. So I picked 5 across the snow. It crawled the skin to think that people love watching movies that encourage violence against its hell. The budget was low and it was garbage! I think I can do better. I think it's the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, and the actor shouldn't bother looking at the garbage and terrifyingly looking at the camera. I think the picture was bad and the sound was not scratched. I rip it off with a squeak in the packaging machine and it's Hyogu at all.","I'm the type of person who always goes to the horror section when I choose a movie, so I've picked five by eye, so I'm tired of this movie and there's no storyline and the point where you can enjoy it is I didn't think it caused my skin to crawl as people liked watching movies that encourage violence. It was low budget and very rubbish! I think I can do it better myself. I think it was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Don't worry, the actor was throwing away the trash, the camera was terrible, the pictures were bad and the sound wasn't terrible. I think it was a little. It didn't work at all, as if any project suddenly rips away from the baler, it was a foul."
"Seven Ups was compared to Bullitt in the Chase scene, but it's not a match for Bullitt. Bullitt started building build build. When McQueen leaves the Sidi Hotel and enters the Mustang parked beneath the Embarcadero Freeway, when you see the charger sit nearby, you know you're trying to see something cool. From that moment on, when McQueen started the car, the best car chase sequence began. Adding to it is a great Lalo Schriffin if you remember a great soundtrack. This continues long before the first tire is actually heard. McQueen's Mustang shot, suddenly appearing in Bill Hickman's rearview mirror, is incomparable with visual effects. Hickman's surprise and double take actually add to the effect. Of course, San Francisco can't compare a car racing up and down a hill with a car that has bends. Also, Bullitt was filmed in the sixties in the 1970's Seven Ups, when the car still made a better wheelset for the ""hot"" (Mustang GT and Dodge Charger) and then two boring smog devices Pontiac. Bill Hickman was the driver of the bad guys car in both films. When I was reviewing a film on paper, I saw it sitting inside an insider movie preview once on the Univeral site. Despite the chase scene, I made a good attempt at Seven Ups. The seven ups had a few “jumps” on the little hill (of course), but not the San Francisco hills. In fact, the fast-paced Seven Ups chase is longer than Bullitt's fast-paced sequence. However, the single shotgun explosion that completely blows off Roy Schieders Pontiac's hood is an absurd height. Strict Hollywood would say, except that it was filmed in New York.","Seven-up has been compared to Brit in the chase scene, but there is nothing comparable to Brit. Bullitt has the beginning of builds builds builds. McQueen exits the dubious hotel and enters his Mustang parked under the Embarcadero Highway (now dismantled), and when he notices a charger sitting nearby, something spectacular You can see that you are trying to see. From that moment, McQueen starts the car and begins the best car chase sequence ever shot. Add to this, and if you remember the soundtrack correctly, it would be a great Lalo Schriffin. This lasts for a long time before you actually hear the first tire squeal. That shot of McQueen's Mustang, suddenly appearing in Bill Hickman's rear-view mirror, is unrivaled in visual impact. Hickman's surprise and double-take appearance really enhances the effect. And of course, San Francisco is unmatched in its winding car settings, going up and down hills. Also, the Brit (Mustang GT and Dodge Charger), shot in the 1960s when the car was still ""hot"", outnumbered two boring smog devices with two boring smog devices in the 1970s seven-up. I made an excellent wheel set. Bill Hickman was the bad guy's car driver in both films. When I was doing a movie review in a newspaper, I saw him sitting in a preview of an insider movie once in a college lot. They made a good attempt at it in the chase scene with Seven Up. The seven ups had some ""jumps"" on a small hill (yawn), but of course not on the San Francisco hills. The Seven-Up Chase is where it really is, but it is longer than the Brit's fast sequence. However, the shotgun explosion scene that completely blows the hood of Roy Schieders Pontiac is absurd. I think it's strictly Hollywood, but it was shot in New York."
"Have you ever heard people say ""to spread their intentions""? In this film, the character's action goes beyond writing future plans as telegraphs. You can forgive if you use the settings better, if your character is more charismatic, or if there are subtle differences. Embes David's character is not mysterious, it's just a tree, and Kenneth Branach is unsuccessful in conveying the blatant charms his character used. Annoying ""southern"" accent used by British actors.","Have people ever heard the word ""telegram their intentions""? In this movie, the character's actions don't just telegram future plans. I'm drunk, appearing at home, and worried about my head. This can be allowed if the settings are used more appropriately, or if the character is more charismatic or subtle. The character of Embeth Davids is not mysterious, it is wooden, and Kenneth Brunner has not succeeded in conveying the serious charm that his character probably had. Incomparable characters and grotesque ""Southern"" accents adopted by British actors."
"""Night of the Living Homeless"" was a fairly strong finish to the first half of Season 11. Obviously a parody of various zombie movies, most notably Dawn of the Dead, this episode parallels the homeless with the living dead, as creatures who feed and thrive off of spare change rather than brains.<br /><br />Kyle is blamed for the sudden mass outbreak of homeless people when he, out of the goodness of his heart, gives a $20 to a homeless man in front of his house.More homeless people begin to infiltrate South Park, until the town is completely overrun with them.This is a very strong Randy Marsh episode, as he assumes the role of the shotgun-wielding leader of the adults who take refuge on the roof of But before Randy makes it to the community center, he is accosted by hundreds of homeless people while hilariously screaming ""I don't have any change!!"" Unfortunately, the refugees end up losing Gerald Broflofski to the homeless, when he tries to escape by catching a bus out of town, and unwittingly tosses away all his change for the bus to distract the homeless people. Then he becomes one of them, asking everyone for change.<br /><br />The boys attempt to find out why there are so many homeless people in South Park, and find a man who is a director of homeless studies.They find out that the nearby city of Evergreen used to have a similar problem with the homeless, so they escape to Evergreen to find out what They did to solve the problem. Unfortunately, homeless people break into the man's house, and he attempts to take the easy way out by shooting himself.However, he fails several times, as he shoots himself in the jaw, in the eye, in the chest, in the neck, in the shoulder, screaming horribly until he finally dies.This scene may have been funnier had a similar scene not happened in ""Fantastic Easter Special"" two weeks ago.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a member of the refugees discovers that due to the homeless problem, the property value s have nosedived, thus the bank has foreclosed on his house, making him homeless.Randy immediately turns on him, holding the gun to the man's head.When the man finally begs the others for a few bucks to help him out, Randy pulls the trigger.<br /><br />In Evergreen, the boys find out that the citizens of the town sent the homeless to South Park, and that the passing of homeless from town to town happens all over the country.The boys modify a bus that leads the homeless out of South Park and takes them all the way to Santa Monica, California.<br /><br />The zombie movie parallels and the great Randy Marsh lines make this one definitely re-watchable. 8/10","""Night of the Living Homeless"" was a pretty strong finish until the first half of Season 11. Obviously, various zombie movie parody, especially Dawn of the Dead, contrast this episode with the homeless and the living dead. <br /> <br /> Kyle accuses of a sudden outbreak of homeless people. Because of his goodness, he gave a homeless man in front of him $20. House. More homeless people begin to infiltrate South Park. Until the town is completely driven by them. This is a very powerful Randy Marsh episode. He acts as an adult shotgun user leader evacuating to the rooftop of the Park County Community Center. But before Randy arrived at the community center, he was intoxicated by hundreds of homeless people and cheerfully shouted, ""I haven't changed anything!!"". Unfortunately, refugees lose Gerald Broflovski to the homeless, attempting to escape the homeless bus, and unknowingly throw away all bus changes to distract the homeless. Then he becomes one of them and asks everyone for change. <br /> <br /> The boys find out why there are so many homeless in South Park and try to find a man who is the director of homeless research. They found that the nearby Evergreen town had similar problems to the homeless, so they ran to Evergreen to find out what they did to solve the problem. Unfortunately, homeless people break into the man's house and he tries to take an easy way by shooting himself. But he failed several times, shooting himself with his chin, eyes, chest, neck, shoulders and screaming horribly until his death. This scene may have been a similar one that didn't take place in the ""Fantastic Easter Special"" two weeks ago. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, refugee members have found that the value of the property has plummeted due to homelessness problems, so the bank seized his home and left him homeless. I chose Randy immediately turned him on and held his gun over the man's head. When a man finally begs another to help him for a few bucks, Randy triggers. <br /> <br /> In Evergreen, the boys learned that citizens of the town sent homeless homes to South Park, and homeless passing from town to town is happening all over the country. The boys remodel the bus leaving the homeless out of South Park to Santa Monica, California. <br /> <br /> Zombie movies are on the line and the amazing Randy Marshline definitely makes this bus re-viewable. 8/10"
"<br /> <br /> I don't know who knows what category the movie belongs to, but it's not a horror movie. As for the story, it was quite interesting, but rather slow.

Instead, she ran over there and said, ""I know everything, I have proof! Didn't you expect proof?"" Then she started walking to her as an uncle got up and harmed her. When I was surprised. DUH!

"DOCTEUR PETIOT, starring Michel Serrault, is a cruel story about a brutal person. A doctor who treats a disease in a French resident even if he or she has no compensatory ability. However, he is eating the weakest food among the public. Images and cinematography are great and add to the horrifying feeling of this complex story. He is a perfect psychopath.

"This movie is really evil. Played in urban paranoia of the 70s and 80s and applied to school situations. I'm not saying that urban crime wasn't a problem for many people, school wasn't a problem, or that it wasn't the area, but this malicious exploitation requires biscuits. Violence is more than imaginable in reality, but in this case, it is not an example of a social problem, but white middle and high school students use themselves to turn into crime kingpins in local high schools. Of course he knows how to play the system. Sound familiar? Yes. This shit is a purely violent exploitation, really hard work. Social opinion is hindering calm cruelty. It belongs to the categories such as Trash, Exterminator, Death Wish 2-5, etc.","This movie is really inferior. Perform in the 70's/80's urban paranoia and put it in the context of a school.

It's a terrible and terrible movie The worst cliché I've ever seen. I haven't seen much. I screamed and left the theater after about 40 minutes to find a hard drink to relax. Meryl Streep was terrible as usual. How many wounds and torture can a person suffer? Aidan Quinn's talent has been wasted so often. And who told Gloria Estephan that she could act? Racial stereotypes still apply when attempting to politically modify this film. (The inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches children violin for the underprivileged in poor neighborhood schools). The children were not cute either! It is written to fit a scary script. Ah ah ah ah ah! Wes Craven cried out once. Real fear!,"What a horrible movie!

"The first cube movie was an art movie. It established a world in which all major prototypes of humanity were represented and showed how they struggled to understand a hostile world that they could not understand.

A world where peace is no longer a struggle. The cube was rated on a scale of 10 out of 10, and there was no sequel. <br /> <br /> The second movie, Hypercube, was a huge disappointment.

In the same kind of plot, some elements have been ridiculously modified (e.g. there is a letter instead of a prime number between the cubes, etc., which is totally unconventional and a crappy nothing to say) It's a clearer idea than anything else.) <br /> <br /> Watchers are only part of the Big Bad Experimental, and because the architects aren't listening to anything, they want to do something “behind the scenes”. It doesn't make sense to look at it. And in this movie, only the one who reached the exit (as Kazan did at the end of the first movie) was killed. Does *breep* mean that? It's just ridiculous stupidity. I didn't have to pay to see this. <br /> <br /> The production value and acting on Cube Zero isn't too bad, but the stories and ideas have no inspiration for this movie. I only get 3 out of 10 points."
"I watched this movie on DVD late this morning and I was so disappointed that I thought it was a good joke for the audience. In other words, the producer planned to make a comedy rather than a drama. But eventually I realized that Tony Giglio was serious about this film. The conversation is ridiculous, the smoke is poor, there is no life, and the story is a fishy story! Poor Ryan Phillippe- Despite his efforts, his character in the movie probably remains his worst performance! What to say to Jason Statham-I lack all the skills to develop a fictional fictional role... for this reason I do",私は今朝遅くにこの映画をDVDで見たばかりで、それが観客にとって良い冗談だとさえ思ったほどがっかりした。つまり、クリエイターはコメディをドラマではなく作ろうと計画しました。とはいえ、最後に私はトニージリオさんがこの映画に熱心であることに気づきました。それは残念です：対話はばかげている、演技は貧弱で活気がない、物語は怪しい話です！貧しいライアン・フィリップ-彼の努力にもかかわらず、映画の彼のキャラクターはおそらく彼の最悪のパフォーマンスのままです！ジェイソン・ステイサムのために何を言うべきか-架空のフィクションである役割を開発するためのあらゆる種類のスキルの欠如...このため、私は投票します：3/10
"I think Shakespeare beautifully explained what I just read. I think (she) has too many protests. Everything sounded to me as if the author was trying to convince himself! Although he mentions the Bible several times (texts of the same age but not related to the Bible), I can think of at least three references from the top of the head that lend historical accuracy to events in the Bible. Anyone can distort the data and prove what they want, but this is not true. Customs change and word definitions change over time (see where English and German have something in common). Nothing changes, it always grows and changes. There are many translations in the Bible, but the King James version proved to be the best for any kind of study. Notice that there is a certain word in italics in the King James Version. These words have been added by translators, and may drop the average of the whole verse. The writings from the time of Christ were written without spaces, without punctuation marks, without paragraphs, and without verses. This article looks like a long word and translators added all of the above. For example, how would you read this? GODISNOWHERE Do you read that God is nowhere or do you read it like God is here now? Two completely different meanings of the same character string. That's why many Bible researchers help to translate using'Lexicon' because they provide words that can be translated into Arabic, Greek, or Hebrew native languages, depending on the original language of the Bible. Also, when translating into symbolic logic, we can prove that God exists, but we cannot prove that He does not exist. After all, I like to hear that people who think they are smart deserve to judge the Almighty. Talk about self!

"If you see animals seeing live skin, their heads bumping, and the dog's neck trampling, this one is for you! But if you are rather plain and don't need to see real scenes of animal cruelty, pass this on. This movie is about to shock the viewers. At first, it was possible to turn off the movie by simply blocking the nose and killing the baby in the movie. Before that, a slaughterhouse video (BTK movie) came out and this kind of video should not be allowed in horror movies. We can see gore and horror because we just know the makeup and special effects. Watch the movie and see the actual killing of the animals, not the ones we rented. Whatever you do, put a big warning label on this kind of garbage film so people won't be surprised.

"Responding to previous comments from locals where this film was filmed: One person suggested that the surrounding area was stagnant due to the closure and destruction of the Oceanview Amusement Park. This is simply not true. Constructing Highway 64 to bypass the Oceanview area. Before, the main route of transportation went through the center of Ocean View. When the highway was completed, Ocean View quickly became a ghost town with business closed and crime increasing. This has significantly reduced the park's income and faced a new competition at Williamsburg's nearby Bush Gardens. Meanwhile, in the past few years, the city of Norfolk has been working on fostering redevelopment, making the area a quest for luxury home construction. <br /> <br /> The destruction scene of the roller coaster is said to have been used in the movie ""Roller Coaster"". This is also not true. The video is a scene of two coaster cars protecting the vehicle for the movie, but the actual explosion and collapse is only for ""Death of Ocean View Park"". As for the film itself, the ""supernatural"" power in the water adjacent to the park was silly, but it was rather typical for the B-class film of the time. It is not surprising that in almost every scene with the cast, the main actor ate the scenery. I don't think this movie was intended for another ""Citizen Kane"". I think Playboy experimented with the new non-nude format to determine whether this is a company-expandable area (probably not!). The strange power of the hand, which caused a strange event at the old amusement park, probably made a good noise at the conference hall, but could not be executed. The roller coaster and the rest of the park headed for the wreck anyway. ""Explosive!

"I was very excited about Mr.Amitabh Bachan's role in SARKAR, but I was disappointed. I was not ready for this kind of movie, as directed by Ram Gopal Verma.

In Tamil there is a movie called Nayakan with the theme of Heavenly Father, led by Kamala Hassan. The film was well directed, and to the end, power remains in the hands of Kamala Hassan, not his son. Amitabh Bachan seems too helpless in the movie and accepts everything instead of changing things.

"I thought that ROTJ was clearly the best out of the three Star Wars movies.I find it surprising that ROTJ is considered the weakest installment in the Trilogy by many who have voted.To me it seemed like ROTJ was the best because it had the most profound plot, the most suspense, surprises, most emotional,(especially the ending) and definitely the most episodic movie.I personally like the Empire Strikes Back a lot also but I think it is slightly less good than than ROTJ since it was slower- moving, was not as episodic, and I just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as I did with the third movie.<br /><br />It also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for ROTJ being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole.I have heard many strange reasons such as: a) Because Yoda died b) Because Bobba Fett died c) Because small Ewoks defeate da band of stormtroopers d) Because Darth Vader was revealed<br /><br />I would like to debunk each of these reasons because I believe that they miss the point completely.First off, WHO CARES if Bobba Fett died??? If George Lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die.Don't get me wrong I am fan of Bobba Fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not Lucas' intention to make him a central character in the films that Star Wars fans made him out to be. His name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie... You had to go to the credits to find out Bobba Fett's name!!! Judging ROTJ because a minor character died is a bit much I think... Secondly, many fans did not like Yoda dying.Sure, it was a momentous period in the movie.I was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic.All the good guys can't stay alive in a realistic movie, you know. Otherwise if ALL the good guys lived and ALL the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy Saturday morning cartoon. Another aspect to this point about people not liking Yoda's death.. Well, nobody complained when Darth Vader struck down Obi Wan Kenobi in A New Hope.(Many consider A New Hope to be the best of the Trilogy) Why was Obi Wan's death okay but Yoda's not... hmmmmmmmmmmmm....Another reason I just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible.That is utterly ridiculous!! I can not believe this one First off, the Ewoks are in their native planet Endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there.If you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the Ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent Use of their home field advantage.(Since you lived in the forest all your life I hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage) They had swinging vines, ropes, logs set up to trip those walkers, and other traps. The stormtroopers were highly disad vantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest.The only thing they had was their blasters.To add, it was not like the Ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves, they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest.I thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the Star Wars heros, the band of rebels, as well as the huge clan of Ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain, that would have been a great upset.Lastly, if this scene was still unbelievable to you..How about in Empire Strikes Back or in A New Hope where there were SEVERAL scenes of a group consisting of just Han Solo, Chewbacca, and the Princess, being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view!! And not only that, the heroes, of course, always hit the Stormtroopers with their blasters.The troopers must have VERY, VERY bad aim then! At least in Empire Strikes Back, the Batt le of Endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not 3 heroes against a legion of stormtroopers. Don't believe me? Check out the battle at Cloud City when our heroes were escaping Lando's base. Or when our heros were rescuing Princess Leia and being shot at (somehow they missed)as Han Solo and Luke were trying to exit the Death Star.<br /><br />The last reason that I care to discuss (others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here.) is that people did not like Darth Vader being revealed! Well, in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie.Luke was trying to find whether or not Darth Vader was his father, Annakin Skywalker. It would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without Luke getting to see his father's face because it made it complete.By Annakin's revelation it symbolized the transition Darth Vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side (in his helmet) and to the good person he was Annakin Skywalk er (by removing the helmet).The point is that Annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about.In fact, that's is what I would have done in that scene too if I were Luke's father...Isn't that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmet?<br /><br />On another note, I think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel MUST be worse (even if it is better) that preceding movies is another reason that ROTJ does not get as many accolades as it deserves.I never go into a film with that deception in mind, I always try to go into a film with the attitude that ""Well, it might be better or worse that the original .. But I can not know for sure.. Let's see."" That way I go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really was.<br /><br />I am not sure who criticiz es these movies but, I have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite Star Wars movie and they all tell me (except for one person that said that A New Hope was their favorite) that it is ROTJ. I believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleading.<br /><br /> Bottom line, the Return of the Jedi was the best of the Trilogy.This movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its 135 minutes.There was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful, exciting, surprising, or all of the above.For example, the emotional light saber battle between Luke and his father in ROTJ was better than the one in the Empire Strikes Back any day!!!<br /><br />Finally, I hope people go see the Phantom Menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky, insignificant details (or see it as ""just another sequel"") to trash the movie such as ""This movie stinks because Luke is not in it!"" then this mer itorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like ROTJ suffered unfortunately.<br /><br />",3つのスターウォーズ映画の中で、ROTJが明らかに最高だと思いました。投票した多くの人が、ROTJが三部作の中で最も弱い割賦と見なされているのは驚くべきことです。私にとって、ROTJは最も奥深いプロット、最もサスペンス、驚き、最も感情的な（特にエンディング）、そして間違いなく最もエピソード的な映画を持っているので、最高のようでした。私は個人的にEmpire Strikes Backもたくさん好きですが、動きが遅く、一時的なものではなかったため、ROTJよりも少し劣ると思います。3つ目の場合ほどサスペンスや感情を感じませんでした。映画。<br /> <br />また、これらの意外なレビューを読んだ後、ROTJが他の2つよりも劣っているという理由で人々が引用した理由は単なるばかげたものであり、純粋な卓越性と比較して重要ではない理由でもあるようです映画全体の。次のような多くの奇妙な理由を聞いたことがあります。a）ヨーダが亡くなったためb）ボバフェットが亡くなったためc）小さなイウォークがストームトルーパーのバンドを倒したためd）ダースベイダーが明らかにされたため<br /> <br />酔っぱらいしたいこれらの理由のそれぞれは、彼らが要点を完全に逃していると私は信じているからです。まず、ボバ・フェットが亡くなった場合、誰が心配するのか???ジョージ・ルーカスが彼に死ぬことを望んだならば、彼は彼に死ぬことを望んだ。誤解しないでください。私はボバフェットのファンですが、彼はいくつかのカメオ出演をしました。スターウォーズのファンが彼を造った映画の中心人物とすることは、ルーカスの意図ではありませんでした。彼の名前は映画のどこにも言及されていませんでした...ボバフェットの名前を見つけるにはクレジットにアクセスする必要がありました!!!マイナーなキャラクターが亡くなったためにROTJを判断することは、私が思うに少し多めです。確かに、それは映画の中で重要な時期でした。私も彼が死ぬのを見てうれしかったが、それは映画をより現実的にする。すべての善良な人が現実的な映画で生き続けることはできません、あなたは知っています。それ以外の場合、すべての善人が生き、すべての悪者が亡くなった場合、この映画は安っぽい土曜日の朝の漫画に相当します。ヨーダの死を好まない人々についてのこの時点の別の側面。さて、ダース・ベイダーがニュー・ホープでオビ・ワン・ケノービを打ち倒したときに誰も不満を述べなかった。 （多くの場合、新しい希望が三部作の最高であると考えています）オビワンの死は大丈夫だったのに、ヨーダはそうではなかったのです...うーん、うーん、もう1つの理由は、人々がストームトルーパーを圧倒しているかわいいイウォークが見つけたからです。不可能です。それはまったくばかげています!!これは信じられない！最初に、Ewoksは彼らの故郷の惑星Endorにいるので、彼らはそこに住んでいるので、自分の家の地形を認識しています。映画を注意深く見ると、ストームトルーパーを倒すためにイウォークが使用した戦術の多くは、ホームフィールドでのアドバンテージの優れた使用によるものでした。 （あなたは一生森に住んでいたので、私はあなたがそれをあなたの利点に利用することを学んだと思います）彼らはぶら下がっているつる、ロープ、それらの歩行者をつまずくために設置された丸太、および他のトラップを持っていました。ストームトルーパーは数が多く、森の利点を認識していないため、非常に不利でした。彼らが持っていた唯一のものは彼らのブラスターでした。付け加えると、イウォークがストームトルーパー自身と戦っているようではなく、彼らはその征服における反乱軍の勢力によって大いに支援された。ストームトルーパーがスターウォーズの英雄、反乱軍のバンド、そして彼らの家の地形に非常に精通している巨大な一族のイーウォークを倒したとしたら、それは大きな動揺だっただろう。最後に、このシーンがまだあなたにとって信じられないものだったとしたら..エンパイアストライクバックや、ハンソロ、チューバッカ、プリンセスだけで構成されるグループのいくつかのシーンがあり、ストームトルーパー10人に撃たれたときはどうでしょうか。そして、ヘロが完全に見えている間、彼らのすべてのブラスターは逃しました!!それだけでなく、もちろん、ヒーローたちは常にストームトルーパーをブラスターで撃ちました。兵士はそのとき非常に、非常に悪い狙いを持っている必要があります！少なくともエンパイアストライクバックでは、ストームトルーパーの軍団に対して3人のヒーローではなく2人の軍隊がお互いに穴をあけたので、エンドアの戦いははるかに信じられました。信じられない？ヒーローがランドの基地から逃げ出したときのクラウドシティでの戦いをご覧ください。または、私たちの英雄がレイア姫を救い、ハンソロとルークがデススターから出ようとしていたときに撃たれた（どういうわけか逃した）とき。<br /> <br />私が議論したい最後の理由（他はちょうど私がここで自分の時間を過ごすのがあまりにも明白でばかげている）人々は、ダースベイダーが明らかにされることを好まなかったということです！まあ、多くの点でそれは映画の陰謀の主要な部分でした。ルークは、ダースベイダーが父親であるアナキンスカイウォーカーであるかどうかを調べようとしていました。映画が完成してルークが父親の顔を見ることができずに映画が終わったとしたら、それはがっかりしたことでしょう。アナキンの啓示によって、それはダースベイダーがダークサイド（ヘルメット内）に憑依されることから受け継がれ、善人に（ヘルメットを外すことによって）アナキンスカイウォーカーになったことを象徴していました。ポイントは、アナキンが再びライトサイドに変換されて死亡したことであり、それがヘルメット取り外しシーンの意味でした。実際、それが私がルークの父親だったら、そのシーンで私がしたことでもあります...あなたが死ぬ前に自分の目で息子を見て、機械化されていなかったら、あなたがしたであろうことではありませんヘルメット？<br /> <br />別のノートでは、ほとんどの人の間の潜在意識または意識の期待は、前の映画がROTJが得られないもう1つの理由であるということで、続編が（それがより良いとしても）悪くなっているはずだと思いますそれにふさわしい多くの称賛。私はその欺瞞を念頭に置いて映画に出ることは決してありません。「まあ、それはオリジナルの方が良いかもしれないし悪いかもしれませんが、確かにわからない..見てみましょう。 」そうすることで、私はオープンマインドで行き、明らかに優れた映画は実際のように良くないという考えに騙されません。<br /> <br />これらの映画を誰が批判するのかはわかりませんが、私は尋ねました多くの大学生や大人が好きなスターウォーズ映画はどれですか。彼ら全員が、「ニューホープが好きだったと言った1人を除いて」それがROTJだと私に話しました。これらの世論調査の結果は恐ろしいものであり、かなり誤解を招くものだと思います。<br /> <br />結論として、ジェダイの帰還は三部作の中で最高でした。この映画は、私がその135分間ずっとリベットされ続けた3つのうちの1つだけでした。各シーンがサスペンス、エキサイティング、驚き、または上記すべてのいずれかであったため、退屈の瞬間はありませんでした。たとえば、ROTJでのルークと彼の父親の間の感情的なライトサーベルバトルは、エンパイアストライクバックの戦いよりも優れていました!!! <br /> <br />最後に、私は人々が「ルークがいないのでこの映画は悪臭を放つ！」のような映画を捨てるのにファンが細々とした、取るに足らない細部（または「単なる別の続編」と見なす）を探し始めたら、心を開いてください。その後、この功績のある映画は、ROTJが不幸に苦しんだように嘲笑の対象となるもう1つの壮観な映画になるでしょう。<br /> <br />
"Crossfire is one of the best Hollywood message movies because, unlike the Great Intentions Shrine Convention, which won the theater for months, the furious star chose to send messages through a great noir thriller format, rather than saying ""continuously."" ""It's much easier to get a message that hate gets stuck in the gun when it's real than the dead are metaphorical."" Somewhat ashamed, the simple feature of the Warners DVD does not mention that novelist Richard Brooks did not own the movie as a transition from a homosexual murder to an anti-Jewish murder, but that the victim is predominantly Sam Levene's performance, and the character is actually gay. There is little doubt in fact. It's not a mining caricature, but along with George Cooper's chaotic soldiers, there's definitely a lost soul aspect in his scene. There is not much mystery about who the killer is. The murderer's body language is immediately recognizable, even if the murder is done in the classic noir shadow, but the film drifts to the same conclusion that its traits are before the midpoint:... The tension comes from proving it and saving the fall man < br /> <br /> There are elements of Ealing Films in the gang of soldiers. Blueprint of Hue and Cry)) The atmosphere is pure RKO Noir. This one-hot night was full of dark dark blacks and shadows from the economy rather than style (reduced lighting time and director Edward De Mittrk spent more time working with the actor). The great cast is relaxed but quietly telling of the charismatic Robert Mitch Tomb, the detective like Robert Young's My Grey, the trap of Gloria Grey Hame, and the constant horror of Paul Kelly, who glorifies her intense liar. Others try to bond. As a person who can do a good vacation alone, it is about excellent performance. What surprised Dmytryk and producer Adrian Scott in 1946 was HUAC's investigation, which tended to be notable for targeting Jews. Crusaders too","Crossfire chooses to send a message via a good noir thriller, rather than the desperate star always saying, unlike the spectacularly intended gentleman's agreement that was overwhelmed by the theater in a few months. I continue to be one of the best Hollywood message movies, because I am Jewish, right? Hatred is much easier to get the message that the corpse is, in the real world, not a figurative thing, like a loaded gun. A little embarrassingly, the brief feature on the Warners DVD does not mention that novelist Richard Brooks denied the film about the transition from homophobic to anti-Semitism murder. I am a Jew. There's little doubt in Sam Leben's performance that the character is actually gay-not an engraved caricature, but two lost soul aspects in the scene with George Cooper's confused soldiers. there is. There isn't much mystery about who the murderer is: Even if the killing is carried out in the shadow of the classic Noir, the body language of the murderer is instantly recognizable, but the movie character does the same conclusion along the way. Drift to: The tension arises from proving it and saving the man in the fall. <br /> <br /> There is an element of the Ealing movie to the gang of soldiers teaming up to remove their buddies from the fix (you're mostly blueprints of Hue and Cry on that side), but The atmosphere is pure RKO Noir. Set in a long nap night, the film has a stunning look, filled with deep dark blacks and shadows born of the economy as much as style (reducing lighting time and allowing Edward Dmitrick to work with the actor). I increased the time). A good cast makes the most of the screenplay: laid-back and quietly charismatic Robert Mitchum, Robert Young's Meghre-like detective, Gloria Graham wanderer, and obsessive-liar worshipers. Eternally creepy Paul Kelly, tries the story in a way others try on a tie. But what impresses me is Robert Ryan's excellent performance as a person who can do the best to do the best to drag an incorrectly accused man to the death penalty and be successful alone. There was a big surprise hit in 1946. In return, Dmitrik and producer Adrian Scott were investigated by HUAC, who is very prone to targeting Jews. So much for the crusades"
"This film is basically a very well-made piece, and it shows the war situation and its impact on the people involved. It's always interesting to see stories from the'other' side of change. The film focuses on the Second Army of Germany dispatched to Stalingrad, Russia after participating in the North African campaign. We usually see the Germans simply as'villains'. The'villains' in this film give a human face and voice, and make them realize that the only real enemy in war is the war itself and not necessarily the fighters. At first, it is difficult to focus on a movie even by thinking that the Germans are evil villains. But, of course, quickly becoming accustomed to adapting the Germans as the protagonists of the film and starting to get interested. <br /> <br /> The way this story is said, however, is not the best. It is difficult to track a story because it moves from one sequence and location to another. Movies are not always logical in storytelling, and there are too many sequences that are too vague. Also, in most cases, it is very difficult to distinguish the character and see who is who. It's not always easy to watch this movie, but on the other hand, it has enough sequences and moments to make it a valuable and fun movie. In that sense, Hollywood movies are always better than European movies. <br /> <br /> The production value is high and has a nice set and location, but it was not filmed by Russia itself. It helps to create a good wartime situation atmosphere. However, for some reason, the official character always works well in war movies and enhances drama and realism. It also helps actors act. Not all actors are the best-known actors around (though Thomas Kretzmann was still an unknown actor at the time), they fit well into each role and give the character a unique face and personality. <br /> <br Due to the original approach and great production value from the German side in the Battle of Stalingrad, it's not the best or consistent World War II drama, but it's worth a look. <br /> <br /> 7/10","This film is basically a very good work, and impresses me well with the situation of the war and its influence on the people involved. It's always interesting to see a story from the ""opposite side"" of change. The film focuses on a group of German soldiers sent to Stalingrad, Russia, after fighting in a North African campaign. It is home to one of the most infamous and bloody battles of World War II. <br /> <br /> It's interesting We can always see the other side of this fight because we always consider the Germans to be just ""villains"". In this film, these ""villains"" have been given humane faces and voices, letting them understand that the true enemy of war is the war itself, not necessarily the one you are fighting. At first it's a bit difficult to concentrate on the movie. I always keep in mind that Germans are evil villains. Of course, as soon as I got used to it, I adopted the German as the main character of the movie, and I started to get interested and interested. <br /> <br /> I don't know how to tell this story. But not the best. Sometimes it's difficult to keep track of stories because you jump from one sequence and location to another. Movie storytelling is not always logical and there are too many sequences that remain ambiguous. Also, in most cases, it's quite difficult to disaggregate a character and see who is who. It's not always easy to watch, but on the other hand, it has enough sequences and moments to make it worthwhile and interesting. Not the most consistent one. In that respect, Hollywood movies are always better than European movies. <br /> <br /> The production is worth it, and with some nice-looking sets and locations, this film hasn't even been filmed in Russia. It helps create a good wartime atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Characters are almost a little funny, but probably funny. But I don't know. For some reason, formula characters always work well in war movies, enhancing drama and realism. It also helps that they are played by well-cast actors. Not all actors are the most famous ones (Thomas Tretchman was also a little-known actor at the time), but each actor fits well into his role and gives the character a unique face and personality. I will. <br /> <br /> Overall, not the best or most consistent World War II drama, but at first glance due to the German side's unique approach to the Battle of Stalingrad and excellent production value. Worth it. <br /> <br /> 7/10"
"Someone gave me this from Roger Ebert's book, ""I hate it and hate it and hate this movie"", so Netflix borrowed it. And he gave a rare 0 star rating in this book and said ""Mad Dog Time"" at the end of the original review. You have to cut to provide free ukulele choices for the poor. ""So I knew from Ebert that I could see if he was as bad as he said. I say most societies judge themselves without listening to critics, but I couldn't express how much I hated this crap like Ebert, and I couldn't tell you how much of Rover Liner's."" Ever since Ever's review of ""North"" he never said he didn't like 10 movies. I've heard movie reviews that I hate many times, where we used Richard Dreyfuss as a gangster and Dreyfuss if the scenario for this movie was well written. I don't think it's terrible to see it as a gangster, but, above all else, I'm pretty sure that the script wasn't written properly above all the horrible things about this ""movie."" Dreyfuss's woman while Dreyfuss was in the crime hospital as the movie started with Jeff Goldblum. Saying that you enjoyed seeing your friends, the movie starts with a decent conversation after the opening credits, but after those first 4 to 5 minutes, the other 85 minutes consist of stupid characters that speak of meaningless trash for 30 seconds, then Dreyfuss is mentally ill. There are a lot of jokes about it, it's not fun, then there's an unpleasant and unpleasant scene parodying Frank Sinatra's ""My Way"" that Gabriel Byrne sang to insult the drapers. Of course the scenario will shoot Byrne more than 5 times in the Dreyfuss level of the 6th grade, so Byrne will not die.As an audience we should even take care of the fun?I ​​can see that I am not very funny. Not only was he disappointed with the Dreyfuss (who earned a lot of respect as an actor) who made and appeared on the trip, ""Independence Day"" was the best of the year. Jeff Goldblum was also very disappointed because it was released in the same year that was a high-yielding piece. One of the most successful films in history this year and ultimately. Did Goldblum think ""Independence Day"" was a flop, and if ""Independence Day"" was a bomb, did you take on the next role given to him to make money? What made the Oscar winners and the two biggest movie stars in history remotely entertaining about this? The opening sequence for ""Mad Dog Time"" says the movie is set on another planet. Looking at this trash, I thought I was wasting 93 minutes and opening it at a theater in the district. Life that will never come back. Everett doesn't like saying that the movie should be cut. All copies of ""Mad Dog Time"" must be gasoline-infused and lighted. This movie has earned its reputation as the worst movie, so I couldn't top the worst movie I've ever seen.","So I rented this from Netflix because someone gave me a Roger Ebert book ""I hate, hate, hate this movie"", and he gave this a rare zero star rating in the book. And should be cut to provide a free ukulele pick for the poor, who said, ""Mad Dog Time"" at the end of his first review. So I was telling Evert to see if it was really as bad as he said. I know most societies don't listen to critics and tell them to judge for themselves, but I can't express how much I hate this junk piece like Evert, and Robert He has heard such a great hate movie review that he hated the movie since Rainer's ""North"" review. Richard Dreyfus is here as a gang, but I don't think it would be terrible to see Dreyfus as a gang if the screenplay for this movie was well written. But more than anything terrible about this ""movie"", I can say that the script was certainly not well written. The movie begins with Jeff Goldbram saying Dreyfus enjoyed Dreyfus's girlfriend while in a criminal hospital, but the movie begins with a decent conversation after the opening credits. But after the first 4-5 minutes, the remaining 85 minutes, someone will be shot after talking meaningless trash for 30 seconds. Then there are a lot of jokes about Dreyfuss being mentally ill. my mother. Uninteresting. Then Frank Sinatra's ""My Way"" is sung by Gabriel Byrne, and you get the unpleasant and weird scene parody of apparently insulting Dreyfus. Of course, the script was written at the 6th grade level, so Dreyfus will shoot Burn more than five times and Burn will not die. Is our audience supposed to care about it or find it a little more interesting? I can certainly say that I didn't care or didn't find it interesting. Not only was I disappointed with Dreyfus (the person I admire as an actor) who produced and starred in this tripe, I was also very disappointed with Jeff Goldblum. One of the most successful films of the year, and ultimately, history. Did Gold Bram feel that ""Independence Day"" would fail, and only took on the next role offered to him to make money if ""Independence Day"" was a bomb? Did the Oscar winner and the biggest two money-making movie stars ever make far away about this? The Mad Dog Time opening sequence shows that the film is set on another planet. So that no one on earth would ever miss this ridiculous waste of 93 minutes from here, 93 minutes wasted on seeing the trash that would have been retained and opened in theaters on earth. Not life. Evert isn't enough to say that the film should have been cropped. All copies of ""Mad Dog Time"" should be filled with gas and lit. This isn't the top of the worst movie I've ever seen. This is because it has been honored as the worst movie in history."
"It's a boring movie! To sum up, basically, Nana Pateka hit her daughter-in-law Charisma Kapoor and she tried to run away from town with her son. Can someone say BORING ??? The concept wasn't bad, but it didn't work. Canadian locales and some village scenes were filmed nicely. However, the overall method of shooting was lacking. The story may have been good, but the movie just seemed to be attracted. There are plenty of stupidity that a person can take, as well as three bloody hours. <br /> <br /> The most important part of the whole movie was the song ""Ishq Kamina"", which took only 5 minutes. Other than that, this movie was a mess.","What a dull movie! In essence, while she was trying to escape from the village with her son, it was basically just Nana Patekal defeating his stepdaughter, Charisma Kapoor. Can someone say BORING???

The story may have been great, but the movie just seemed trailing.

"{Rant start} I didn't want to believe them at first, but I think people are talking when people say that Korean movies have peaked and are going downhill. Indeed, after the amazing, fun and animated monster movie ""Antiques"" (aka ""Hosts"") of 2006, which created a sharp satire in the genre of B-movie, the successive Korean blockbusters have become more common. Their budget (mainly used for special effects) has become increasingly fantastic. Korean filmmakers want to make a regular budget series of movies like the mainland of China, wasting the goodwill of all the audience and investors their industry has built up since the 1999 breakout movie ""Shiri / Swiri"".? {rant end} <br /> <br /> The only reason I could make this movie is for investors to fund the most detailed and fluid digital animation of the Korean/East Asian style dragon I've seen until the last scene. If they first introduced the dragon and gave it more personality and purpose, such as ""Dragon Heart"" in 1996, the movie would have some more restraint qualities than having many digitally animated dragons. Do you remember the 2000 ""Dungeon & Dragon""? Does anyone know how the trick is, how many special effects you use, not how? I hope they have more (and better) Korean legends available. Because they shot a lot of international interest in the legend of the dragon in Korea in a way that filmed it. <br /> <br /> After all the negative reviews, I wonder what Koreans thought about playing their folk anthem ""Arirang"" at the end. As a creature function, if a special effect or action sequence was worth it, I would have given it 5 or more out of 10. However, I've seen many video games with better camera work and scripting (less dragons).","{Sure start} I didn't want to believe them at first, but I think this is what people are saying that Korean cinemas may peak and fall downhill.

"As a Chinese, I cannot accept this kind of thinking that some people have to die for a'better world'. I said it's a'better world' because it is a lie that Chinese have been indoctrinated for thousands of years! <br /> <br /> I think most of the western audience don't know the pro-Shin (meaning the first emperor). The king of the film is the most infamous tyrant in ancient China. The Tianxia (the Chinese word spoken by the king means'land and people') in his mouth is completely a lie. Since then, all the kings of ancient China have said the same thing, but a few of them have done little of what they said.

"I remember seeing this series fervently every Saturday evening. It was the highlight of the week. I loved everything about Clannad's location, costumes, actors and great music (I still have their legendary album). I liked the way they solved Michael Praed's problem, leaving another Robin this time with Count Huntingdon. I think there are several Robin legends in the Middle Ages. Another thing I liked was the fact that it was full of young actors. Robin and his men are sure that in those days, everyone will be young after not living so long. The other Robin always looks too old (Kevin Costner, with his tone, looked like Robin's grandfather). The only sad thing was the ending. At least I bought one to tie all the loose things together and have a happier ending.",毎週土曜日の夜、このシリーズを熱心に見たのを覚えています。今週のハイライトでした。私はそれ、ロケーション、衣装、俳優、そしてクラナドの素晴らしい音楽（私はまだレジェンドアルバムを持っています）のすべてが好きでした。私は、彼らが別のロビン、今度はハンティンドン伯爵を作って、マイケルプレイドが去る問題を解決する方法が好きでした。中世にはいくつかのロビンの伝説があったと思います。私が好きだったもう1つのことは、若い俳優でいっぱいだったという事実でした。すべての人々が当時それほど長く生きていなかったので、ロビンと彼の部下は若いはずだと確信しています。他のロビンは常に古すぎます（ばかげたアクセントを持つケビンコスナーはロビンの祖父のように見えました）。唯一の悲しいことはエンディングでした。ルーズなエンドをすべて結び付けて幸せなエンディングを与えるために、彼らが少なくとも1回限りのスペシャルを行うことができなかったのは残念です。

"Few would argue that Master Animation Director Hayao Miyazaki is one of the few who has this ability. <br /> <br /> (No. Too many people are focusing on the ""amazing"" ability to steal John La Sitter's other movies. After a pretty puppet show, I was praised as a genius... but I decline. ) <br /> <br /> Miyazaki provides films that deal with important mature issues (generally ecological themes) as films and has an intelligent script. Even the most jealous viewers who despise an animated movie can thoroughly enjoy it when given the opportunity. Nevertheless, Miyazaki (almost) undoubtedly does not forget who will be for the children who watch this movie. <br /> <br /> So I'm lost to think of other filmmakers with this ability. Elsewhere, the three-year-old (my nephew link) will still sit until it moves, and the seven-year-old (my nephew amber) will love everything about him and will be able to watch a movie (with stars) 12 The power of Frankie Jonas and Noah Cyrus of (My Nephew Aaron) is ""Of course good! Everything Miyazaki does is good!"" And love the child's ""cuteness"" (brings to the rest of Karas).<br /> <br /> And that's the most respectful thing about Miyazaki. It's like talking to an audience in a completely different way from a regular filmmaker. It's a simple story skunk (like ""The Little Mermaid"") about a little fish girl who wants to feel the taste of the human world and want to participate in it, but there are completely different levels here. In fact, Miyazaki fills the film with intense female characters. Poyo's mother, Soske's mother, and an elderly woman in a nursing home are all true minds of their own minds and very strong wills. <br /> <br /> The girl eating the cake is Ponyo herself. When she decides she likes the human world, she simply uses her will to fulfill her dreams. Her father tries to make her innocent and protect the magic fish, but the young Ponyo knows what she wants and turns from her resolve to human. <br /> <br /> Being human, she teams up with her friend Soske and loves it (probably not as much as Ham). Soske is asked to be the man of the house (5 years old) when his mother Lisa decides to help the rest of the house who work during the typhoon that accidentally caused a typhoon to be humanized by Ponyo. Frankie Jonas (Yes. He's related to the Jonas brothers. Can I just pass it over?) gives the best performance in the best Soske movie (good because I have the most lines) in the movie. His personality is also a strong will, but he has a very respectful and friendly character. You won't find it in the children's characters on this side of the Pacific Ocean. <br /> <br /> Pony's father, Fujimoto, copes with his daughter's decision and his wife's wish to be human. He wants Pyoyo and Soske to remember ""like him"". And once again, Miyazaki refuses to become a stereotyped “bad guy”. Miyazaki has been criticized a bit for this (for whatever reason), but honestly, that's why his films are magical and relevant. In real life, nobody is a ""bad person."" All humans are of various shades of gray. And that's exactly what Miyazaki is like with his characters. <br /> <br /> And the animation itself. Miyazaki decided to incorporate NO CGI when CGI definitely helped with this movie, especially a lot of effect shots in water. Certainly the hand-drawn animation was colored by digital means, but all the movies in this film are hand-drawn, and I was very grateful for that. The character animation was very fluid and even seemed to cause lip syncing (which is very rare in animation movies). The background seemed to have been rendered with colored pencils, and it all affected the audience. This is what an animation looks like and what it looks like. <br /> <br /> Eventually, I enjoyed Ponyo. Not the best of Miyazaki (I think Kiki's delivery service is still an honor) but still has a taste for the ENTIRE family",マスターアニメーションディレクターの宮崎駿がこの能力を保持する数少ないものであると主張する人はほとんどいません。<br /> <br />（いいえ、あまりにも多くの人が他の映画のプロットを盗み、それらに変えるジョンラシターの「驚くべき」能力に焦点を当てていますかなりの人形劇を見せて、天才として称賛されます。。。。しかし私は余談です。）<br /> <br />宮崎は重要な成熟した問題（通常は生態学的にテーマにされた）を扱う映画を次々と提供し、インテリジェントなスクリプトを持っています通常、アニメ化された映画を軽蔑する最もうんざりしている視聴者でさえ、機会があれば徹底的に楽しむことができます。それでも、宮崎は（ほとんど）間違いなくこれらの映画の子供たちの聴衆に誰が出演するかを決して忘れません。<br /> <br />それでも、私はこの能力を持つ別の映画製作者を考えるのに途方に暮れています。他にどこに、3歳（私の甥のリンク）が移動中にじっと座って夢中になって、7歳（私の姪のアンバー）が彼女自身を愛する（そして「スター12歳（甥のアーロン）のレビューを書いた12歳のフランキージョナスとノアサイラスのパワーは「もちろん良かったです。宮崎さんのやることはすべて良かったです！」という32歳のアニメファンは、強力な監督とゴージャスなアニメーション（それは私だろう）と、58歳の女性（私の母）は、母親のキャラクター（および私は古いチャラスも賭けています）とつながり、子供の「かわいさ」を愛することができます。 <br /> <br />そして、それが宮崎さんについて私が最も尊敬していることです。彼は聴衆に平均的な映画制作者とはまったく異なる方法で話しているようです。表面上、「ポニョ」は人間の世界の味を得て、それに参加したいと思っている小さな魚の少女と彼女がそこに作る友達、少年の名前の簡単な話ske（やや「リトルマーメイド」のようなもの）ですが、ここではまったく異なるレベルでプレイします。造形に忠実に、宮崎は彼の映画に非常に強い女性キャラクター、ポニョの母親、ソスケの母親を投入します。特別養護老人ホームの年上の女性はすべて、自分の心を持ち、非常に強い意志を持つ本物のキャラクターです。<br /> <br />しかし、ケーキを取る女の子はポニョ本人。人間の世界が好きだと決めたら、自分の意志を使って夢を実現します。彼女の父親は彼女を無邪気に保ち、彼女を魔法の魚にしようとしているが、若いポニョは彼女が何を望んでいるかを知っており、彼女自身の決意から人間になる。 <br /> <br />人間になると、彼女は大好きな友達のソスケとチームを組みます（ハムほどではないかもしれませんが）。ソスケは、母親のリサが台風の間に働いている休憩所の人々を助けなければならないと決めたとき（5歳のとき）家の男になるように頼まれました。フランキー・ジョナス（そうです。彼はジョナスの兄弟と関係があります。それを乗り越えてもらえませんか？）は、おそらく、若いソスケ（彼が最も多くのラインを持っているので良い）として映画で最高のパフォーマンスを提供します。彼の性格は強い意志もあるが、太平洋のこの側の子供キャラクターには見られないような非常に敬意と友好的な特徴も持っている。<br /> <br />結局、ポニョの父、藤本は彼の娘の決定に対処し、彼の妻が彼女が人間であることを許可したいという望みを遠ざける。彼はポニョとソスケが「彼を愛情を込めて覚えている」ことを望んでいる。そして再び、宮崎はキャラクターがステレオタイプの「悪者」になることを許可することを拒否します。宮崎は（何らかの理由で）これに対していくらかの批判を受けましたが、正直なところ、それが彼の映画を魅力的でありながらも共感できるものにしているのです。実生活の誰もが完全に「悪い人」ではありません。すべての人間はさまざまな灰色の色合いです。それがまさに宮崎の登場人物です。 <br /> <br />それからアニメーション自体があります。 CGIが確かにこの映画の大量のエフェクトショット、特に水を手助けしていた時代に、宮崎はまったくCGIを組み込まないことを選択しました。確かに手描きのアニメーションはデジタルで彩色されていましたが、この作品のすべての映画は手描きであり、私もその1つに非常に感謝しています。キャラクターのアニメーションは非常に流動的で、リップシンクが進行しているように見えました（アニメ映画では非常に珍しいものです）。背景は色鉛筆でレンダリングされているように見え、聴衆に独自の効果をもたらしました。これは、以前はどのようなアニメーションでしたか、そしてどのように見えるべきかです。 <br /> <br />最後に、私はPonyoが完全に楽しいと感じました。確かに宮崎のベストではない（私の意見では、その名誉はまだキキのデリバリーサービスによって保持されています）が、それでも全家族向けの10つ星の楽しい映画です。

"The great Caruso was the world's biggest hit in 1951, and most of all box office records at Radio City Music Hall for a year. Most ""movers"" stayed at home watching the new 7-inch Motorola TV. The numbers are wrong because they can't adjust for inflation-today's $10 movie will dominate in 1951 at 90c to $1.60 in Washington City, 44c to 75c for the first time at Loew's Palace in Washington DC, and 35c in the neighborhood In the 50c adjusted box office ""media spin"", the number of people responding to the picture is important. The great Caruso genius is that filmmakers took up most of Enrico Caruso's real life. Instead, because 90% of the film's focus was on music, MGM gave us the best living opera singer Mario LANZA, who plays the music of the best-known opera singer ENRICO CARUSO. Too bad LANZA gave up his life and a career in overeating. Edmund Purdom settled with Lanza's voiced dubbed and handsome and nonfat Ranza depicted in the commercials.

"I attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher; both have delivered less than memorable performances & films.While the underlying ""general"" storyline is somewhat familiar, this film was excellent. Both Costner and Kutcher delivered powerful performances playing extremely well off each other.The human frailties and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both; the scene when Costner confronts Kutcher with the personal reasons why Kutcher joined the Coast Guard rescue elite was the film's most unforgettable emotional moment.

"1) I'm not a weapon expert, but I can see the difference between WWI and WWII US Army rifles. In the movie we can see individuals armed with ""M1 Garand"" (invented in 1932), not the authentic ""1903 Springfield"" (aka ""Silent Death""), which individuals use until World War II. Difference -M1 gives 1,5 times more ammo and 3 times more firing rate! M1 was semi-automatic and Springfield had to be reloaded each time. Little difference?! 2) German military uniforms were also rented since 1940. Especially helmet. Until the end of the WWI, the German helmet has a significant pike at the top and can't even see it in movies. How true is this ""true story"" if we do very little further searching in the archives?","1) I'm not a weapons expert, but I can see the difference between US Army rifles in World War I and World War II.

"The film began when Wheeler sneaked into his girlfriend's apartment. Her aunt (Edna May Oliver (who is too talented for this movie)) didn't like Wheeler. Aunt decided to take this noble lady abroad to keep her away from Wheeler. They left and Wheeler invested in the revolution because he promised to make him king in a small mythical kingdom. Almost simultaneously, Ulsi was in the same small mythical kingdom and became king. So when Wheeler arrived, fighting was up to the boys, but they refused because they were already friends. People were greatly disappointed because killing and replacing the king is a national entertainment. <br /> <br /> I'm a comedy fan from the golden age of Hollywood, a quiet era of the 1940s. I've seen and reviewed hundreds if not thousands of movies, but despite my love and appreciation for this movie, I never understood the appeal of Wheeler & Woolsey, the only comedy team that could be as bad as the Ritz brothers! Despite having a short career in Hollywood (shortened due to Robert Woolsey's premature death), practically every other successful team carried out the same basic idea, but I can't tell you it's much better. For example, there were many elements of this movie that reminded me of the Marx brothers' film DUCK SOUP, but CRACKED NUTS never laughed and DUCK SOUP was very gleeful. Sometimes Woolsey talked a bit with Groucho, but his joke doesn't even have a funny punch line remotely! In fact, he just seemed pointless. His only funny quality is that he saw Goofy. Also, Wheeler had a comedy appeal of a piece of cheese, a piece of cheese that was called very incompletely! The missed opportunity was Vaudev ille's old routine, which later became popularized as the ""first person"" of Abbott and Costello in this film, but lacked a wit or a spark of timing. In fact, as soon as they started playing, they ended their daily lives. Too early you get frustrated. I knew ""the first time"" had existed for many years and was used by many teams, but I wanted to give Fairer Wheeler and Woolsey a fair shot and see their twist. <br /> <br /> Once again, I found another sub-par film by this duo. I have to admit that I like some of their films lightly (Silly Billy and rAINMAKERS (actually gave IMDb 6)), but this was a major endurance test to complete.

Duck Soup was a ridiculously fun chat. Occasionally, Woolsey talked a bit like Glucho, but his jokes didn't have an interesting punch line from a distance! In fact, he seemed to rattle insignificantly. His only fun was that he looked silly-certainly, there wasn't enough reason to get him to appear in the film.

"First of all, ""Texas' Mexican Werewolf"" is not a werewolf movie. This title is bullcrap. This story is actually about Chupacabra killing all the locals in the small town of Furlough, Texas. Suppose that the distributor renames the original title and pays extra. And I think it actually works because that's why I bought this garbage. It was so silly. Anyway, the movie is not good.

The worst of them are all stupid guys. She is the worst of them. I have never seen an actor as bad as her (I have seen Pteradactyl). Even when her boyfriend dies, she can't stop being stupid about it. I hate her. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes in this movie were actually pretty good. Places taken during the day are suitable for low-budget projects. However, when the Chupacabra crashes and the lighting is too dark, most movies are filmed at night. The Gore scene is small and short, but in reality it is so enjoyable and violent. The effect is really fun, but it's the way I like it. Chupacabra looks pretty confused, and it's easy to see that it's someone in a suit. <br /> The whole of this film should only be seen by extreme fans watching low-budget films, and it's important not to watch it alone.

"I found this film to be very good in all fields. Acting was great for all characters, especially Ms.Stone and Morissey. Tramell's character is momentarily smart and psychologically twisted. The plot is interesting, but the film is more of a mind playing among the protagonists and Catherine's way of continuing to write with new ways and distortions about the novel. The setting was also great and the overall atmosphere of the movie was mysterious and thrilling like a masterpiece. Go to see this movie. It is more valuable than the movie of the audience.","I found this movie very good in all respects. The acting was superb from all characters, especially Mr. Stone and Morrissey. Trammel characters get smarter every minute and are psychologically twisted. The plot is interesting, but the film is about the playing hearts of the protagonists, and how Catherine continues her writing with new ways and twists for her novel. The setting was great and the overall atmosphere of the movie was a mysterious and thrilling masterpiece. Now go see this movie, it's more valuable than what you got from the audience, it was confused by some false and terrible reviews about the movie (even before it even started.......

"Rather like Paul Newman and Steve McQueen with their racing car movies this has all the appearance of a ""jollies"" project for Robert Redford, as he gets to ski up hill and down dale in the Alpine sunshine.<br /><br /> The story is as light as powdered snow with Redford's small-town boy David Chappellet (what kind of lead name is that?) who with his eyes on the prize of Olympic glory, gets up the nose of, in no particular order, his coach Women are a mere side-show in his insular world as evidenced by a fairly distasteful pick-up scene with an old girlfriend in his hometown and then his selfishly petulant pursuit of, heavens above, a free-thinking, independent woman, played by Camilla Sparv. The ski-ing sequences are fine with some good stunt-work involving numerous bumps and scrapes on the piste but their effectiveness is dimmed by our subsequent familiarity with top TV coverage of skiing events down to the present day. Plus I'm not convinced that the Winter Olym pics has the same mass identification with the general public as the summer games so that when Redford eventually wins his gold medal in the final reel, I couldn't really be that excited for him one way or another.<br /><br /> >Of the actors, Redford, best profile forward, doesn't need to do much and indeed doesn't, while Gene Hackman does better with equally meagre material.Ms Sparv does well as The chief female interest well who treats Redford the way he's doubtless treated every other woman in his chauvinistic way.<br /><br />In truth though, there's a lack of dramatic tension throughout for which the action sequences don't fully compensate and you don't care a fig for any of the leading characters.One of those films where the actors probably enjoyed making it more than the viewers did watching it.","It's not like Paul Newman's or Steve McQueen's racing car movie, but it looks like the ""Jollies"" project as Robert Redford climbs and descends hills in the sunshine of the Alps. <br /> <br /> The story turned to the Olympic glory award, a little town boy in Redford who stands up his coach's nose David Shapellet (that's what kind of lead name ?), father and teammate. Women is just a side show of his island world. A pretty nasty pick-up scene with his hometown old girlfriend, and his free-spirited frustrating pursuit of a free-thinking independent woman played by Camilla. The ski sequence is fine, but there are some good stunt work, including numerous bumps and abrasions on the slopes, but the effect is dimmed as you are accustomed to the top TV coverage of ski events to date. I am. On top of that, the Winter Olympics don't seem to have the same mass identity as the general public, so when Redford finally won a gold medal on the last reel, I wasn't excited in one direction for him. I could not do it. Another 1. <br /> <br /> Of the actors, Red Ford has the best profile and doesn't have to do much and doesn't have to. Gene Hackman, on the other hand, outperforms with similarly poor materials. Ms. Sparv is doing as well as the interest of the main woman who treats Redford in the way he treated all other women in his mean manner without doubt. Do not completely correct. Also, don't worry about the main characters figs. One of the movies that the actor probably enjoyed making more than the viewer watched it."
"This movie is recommended for anyone looking for a comfortable, fun and thought-provoking movie. I had the most enjoyable evening because there was no sex, vulgarity or violence. I especially enjoyed the Buffalo scene, but probably because I live a short distance there. Nevertheless, this film could be produced in any city. This is an important topic.

"This film is an art film produced in 1969 or 1972 (National Film Conservation Foundation 1969, IMDb 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the film seems to represent this general period using some camera work and pop art styles that were pure from the late 60s to the early 70s. <br /> <br /> The movie is one of three simple images distorted using different strange camera tricks. This distorted image comes with music and has no dialogue or conspiracy at all. This is almost as intended as a kind of performing art, and like most performing arts, it's interesting at first, but hassle-free quickly.

I read a book and watch a movie. Both are excellent. The movie is a diamond among the coals of this era. Liebman and Selby dominate the screen and convey the character's strength without flaws. This movie would have been a star for them. I think you're ashamed of the studio for not putting everything behind this movie. It could have been an easy franchise. DVD release is a must and a valuable remake will revive this film. Look in the TV guide and watch the list at the latest. Please do other favors will not be disappointed -.

"A wanderer looking for a job is mistaken for a hitman in a small Wyoming village, causing all sorts of complications. Cage wants to make money quickly and get out of the city, but is perfectly cast as an unfortunate schmuck, knowing he can't escape the title village. Hopper played a psychopath called ""Lyle from Dallas"" while doing his best. Boyle finishes fine with Walsh and Femme Fatal as bent sheriffs. The scripts of the John and Rick Dal brothers include delicious twists and turns, and John's instructions create a great ""Neo Noir"" atmosphere.

"I really liked this movie. I've seen a few Gene Kelly movies and this is one of his best. I would actually put him above his famous American in Paris. Sometimes it seems that the story disappears with a great number of dances and songs in the Gene Kelly movie, but not in the movie. It is worth renting","I really liked this movie.

"I-Scream has been promoted to one of the most sincere Turkish films with amateur star Ice-cream, but it is similar to a sincere caricature. The creamy salesman in the town of Anatolia in the west is using the same marketing methods as a large ice cream company to achieve success. He is a beautiful model in a bikini and dreams of playing and dancing on TV commercials. When his dream turns into a nightmare, he wakes up with a big erection next to his gorgeous wife who refuses to have sex with him for six years for no apparent reason. Is it because he wasn't successful at work? He said that he was selling better in the old days when there was no pressure from the global ice cream company. But this is what he says. We don't actually see him suffer so much. He still sells well and travels to neighboring villages, while his apprentice stays in the store and sells ice cream to the villagers. Ali accuses large companies of using sweeteners and colorants. He uses real ""cabbage"" (root of a mountain orchid). Ali serves ads on local TV channels that prefer to buy motorcycles with bank vendors as travel agencies and broadcast news bulletins in local dialects. His wife doesn't like the way he does business and always fights and threatens to do very bad things in a frenzied moment. <br /> <br /> On a very successful day, he was stolen by the misbehaving little boys in his poor bike town. I go to the police to find a stolen bike and blame a big company for theft, but of course no one takes him seriously. Ali, annoyed by her nagging, goes to a bar and gets drunk. One of the friends at his table, the wannabe of the city, as a socialist, gives a didactic speech, criticizes globalism, and actually jumps on the subject of global freezing without any relevance. Ali decides to return home and kill herself with poison. His wife wakes up and prevents him. The old neighbor takes him to the night promenade and advises him about life. According to him, Ali could sell hot sa drinks if the world freezes around the world. When he returns home, we see his wife understand his value, treat him like a hero and praise his youth. In the meantime, the thieves' boys got sick because they ate too much ice cream. They confess to the doctor that they stole Ali's bike. Ali forgives them and has a happy ending. <br /> <br /> The plot may seem promising, but this film is not true and nonsense. First, the director does not show much effort to tell the story visually. Everything is based on conversation. And the conversation never stops to show that movies are actually visual arts. Even Ali's problem is not persuasive because we cannot see it. We just understand it in his words. The director sells his film in a fair fight against Ali against a large ice cream company, but there is nothing in the film about a large company. We do not see enough of their pressure. The movie actually mocks Ali, who believes that big companies are the cause of the theft. And when his motorcycle is found, he solves all the problems. Ali becomes a happy and powerful husband. It is not a real critique of globalism. <br /> <br /> Second, the movie has no cheese taste due to the rough humor. Maybe some people in Turkey are cursed a lot and make a lot of vulgar jokes in everyday life, but vulgar language and humor aren't enough to make the movie fun. I might have accepted it if they were vulgar and ""smart"", but they are not clever jokes, they just have a cheese taste. Maybe I'm wrong, and Americans may like the oriental version of American Pie Style Humor. But the American Pie never claimed to be an Oscar nominee or to receive a political message! This movie would be fun if you thought you could laugh at a man's big erection in his shorts (and we had to endure this joke twice!) or an old town woman saying ""f**k you"".",私はアマチュアキャストで最も誠実なトルコ映画の1つとして宣伝されていますが、アイスクリームです。IScreamは、誠実さの似顔絵のようなものです。<br /> <br />プロットは、旅する氷、アリの夢から始まります。アナトリア西部の町にいるクリームセールスマン。彼は自分が大手アイスクリーム会社と同じマーケティング手法を使って成功していると考えています。彼の製品のテレビコマーシャルでビキニ姿の美しいモデルと遊んで、彼の周りで踊ることを夢見ています。彼の夢が悪夢に変わると、彼は巨大な妻の隣に大きな勃起で目を覚まします。妻は明確な理由なしに6年間彼とのセックスを拒否します。彼は仕事に成功していないからですか？どうやら、世界中のアイスクリーム会社からの圧力がなかった昔は売れ行きが良かったと彼が言ったからです。しかし、これは彼の言うことです。実際、彼がそれほど苦しんでいるのはわかりません。彼は今でも売れ、近隣の村を旅しながら、弟子が店に滞在し、町の人々にアイスクリームを販売しています。アリは本当の「サレップ」（山の蘭の粉末根）を使用している間、大企業が甘味料や着色料を使用したことを非難します。アリは銀行を借りてバイクを購入し、旅行業者になり、地元の方言でニュース速報を放送することを好む地元のテレビチャンネルに広告を出します。彼の妻は彼のビジネスのやり方が好きではありません、彼らはいつもけんかをします、そしてアリは彼女が彼が狂乱の瞬間に非常に悪いことをするかもしれないと彼女に脅します。町の悪ふざけの男の子に盗まれる。盗まれた自転車を探して、アリは警察に行き、大企業の盗難を非難しますが、もちろん誰も彼を真剣に受け止めていません。妻のしつこい悩みに悩まされたアリは酒場に行き酔いました。彼のテーブルにいる彼の友人の1人、町の志望の社会主義者は、教訓的な演説を行い、グローバリズムを批判し、本当のつながりなしに、グローバルな凍結の話題に飛びつきます。アリは家に戻り、毒で自殺することにしました。彼の妻は目を覚まし、彼を妨げます。古い隣人が彼を夜の散歩に連れて行き、彼に人生について助言します。彼によると、世界が地球規模の凍結に直面している場合、アリは熱いサレップ飲料を販売することさえできます。彼が家に帰ると、突然彼の妻が彼の価値を理解し、彼をヒーローのように扱い、彼の男らしさをほめたたえました。一方、泥棒の男の子は病気になり、アイスクリームを食べすぎました。彼らは、アリの自転車を盗んだことを医者に告白します。アリは彼らを許し、ハッピーエンドがやってきます。<br /> <br />陰謀はある意味有望に見えるかもしれませんが、この映画を不誠実で安っぽくするのは物語を語ることです。まず、監督はストーリーを視覚的に伝えるための努力をあまり見せません。すべてがダイアログに基づいています。そして、対話は私たちに映画が実際に視覚芸術であることを示すために止まることはありません。アリの悩みも私たちには見えないので納得できません。彼の言葉から理解するだけです。監督は彼の映画をアリの大規模なアイスクリーム企業に対する正当な戦いとして売り込んでいますが、大企業については何も映画にありません。彼らのプレッシャーは十分とは言えません。この映画は、大企業が盗難の背後にあると信じてアリを嘲笑している。そして、彼のバイクが見つかったとき、それはすべての問題を解決します：アリは幸せで強力な夫になります。グローバリズムに対する本当の批判ではありません。<br /> <br /> 2番目に、この映画は粗雑なユーモアのために安っぽいです。トルコのその地域の人々は日常生活の中でのろいや下品な冗談をたくさんしているのかもしれませんが、下品な言葉遣いや下品なユーモアでは映画を面白くするのに十分ではありません。彼らが下品で「賢い」の両方であるなら、私はそれを受け入れたかもしれませんが、彼らはまったく賢い冗談ではなく、単に安っぽいです。多分私は間違っているかもしれません、多分アメリカ人はアメリカンパイスタイルのユーモアの東洋版が好きかもしれません。しかし、アメリカンパイは、オスカーの候補者である、または政治的メッセージを持っているという主張はありませんでした！ショートパンツに男性の大きな勃起を見て（そしてこの冗談を2回我慢しなければならなかった！）、または「f ** k you」と言っている村人の女性だけを見て笑えると思うなら、この映画は面白いかもしれません。

"OK 나는 잘 문서화 된 실패 에도 불구 하고 House of the Dead 를 꽤 즐겼다 는 것을 인정 해야 합니다. 그러나 이것은 문 에서 악마 이후 내가 본 최악 의 영화 였습니다.

"나는 80 년대에 태어나지 않은 대부분의 리뷰어들과 달리. 나는 1994 년 5 월 14 일에 태어났습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 제 인생은 80 년대 스타일이었습니다. 다른 아이들이 플레이 스테이션을 가지고있을 때, 나는 나의 NES 등에서 젤다를 연주하고있었습니다. 이제,이 영화는이 리뷰를 쓸 당시 15 살 밖에되지 않았음에도 불구하고 이미 내 마음 속에 특별한 장소를 가지고 있습니다. 나는 80 년대 초반의 어린 시절부터 많은 TV 프로그램을 보았고 다른 아이들이 보지 못한 많은 영화를 보았습니다.이 영화는 그중 하나 였고 가장 큰 영화이기도했습니다. <br /> <br /> It Alvin Seville, Simon Seville, Theodore Seville 및 David Seville의 로스 앤젤레스 홈에서 시작합니다. Chipmunk의 입양 아버지 인 David는 유럽 여행을 가면서 공항에 가기 위해 서두르고 있습니다. 그의 택시가 거의 다 왔고 The Chipmunks가 그를 도와줍니다. 그들이 이야기하는 동안 Alvin은 Dave와 함께하고 세상을 보겠다는 그의 의지를 표명합니다 (그러나 기술적으로 Dave는 유럽에만 갈 것이므로 Alvin에게는 분명히 미국과 유럽 만이``세계 ''자격을 갖습니다). 데이비드는 밀러 양을 보살 피면서 다람쥐들을 떠났고, 소년들의 불만에 시달렸다. 곧 데이브가 공항을 떠났고 다람쥐는 밀러 양과 함께 집에 남아 있습니다. 나중에 현지 카페에서 Chipmunks는 Chipettes (Brittany, Jeanette 및 Eleanore)와의``30 일 만에 전 세계 ''게임을하고 있습니다. Alvin은 악어에 의해 열기구를 하늘에서 먹은 후 Brittany와의 경기에서 패배 한 후, 전 세계 레이스에서 누가 이길 것인지에 대해 Brittany와 논쟁을 벌입니다. 가까운 테이블에 앉아있는 두 명의 다이아몬드 밀수업자 인 클라우스와 클라우디아 퍼츠 치엔은 그들의 주장을 듣고, 다이아몬드를 전 세계로 안전하게 운반 할 수있는 방법으로 아이들을 속여 그들을 속여 들기로 결심했습니다. 그들은 세계 각국에서 레이스를 시작했습니다. 각 팀은 전 세계의 드롭 오프에서 자신의 모양으로 다이아몬드를 채울 수있는 인형을 입금하고 상대 팀의 모습으로 은밀히 인형을받습니다. ``그들이 거기에 있었는지 확인하십시오 ''. 승리 한 팀은 100.000 달러의 보상을받습니다. 그들은 Jamal (지금 몇 시간 동안 발 뒤꿈치에 뜨거워 진 Interpol 요원)이 단지 아이들이기 때문에 그들을 의심하지 않을 것이라고 믿기 때문에이를 수행합니다 (그러나, 여행 중에 아이들은 중복되어 보입니다. 클라우스 나 클라우디아가 다이아몬드를 개인적으로 가져 간다면 클라우스 나 클라우디아도 그렇게 생각하지 않을 것입니다.) 그리고 위대한 모험이 시작됩니다. 이 영화는 고전이며 다른 사람들이 그것을 좋아하지 않을 이유가 없습니다. Kick-ass 음악 (내 프랑스어 : P)은 말할 것도없고 훌륭한 애니메이션과 최고의 음성 연기 기능을 갖추고 있습니다. 내가 가장 좋아하는 노래는 의심의 여지없이 ''The Rock and Rolls의 소녀와 소년들 ''입니다. 영화에서 가장 좋아하는 순간이기도합니다. 다른 주목할만한 노래로는``Getting Lucky ''(어린이 영화 암시의 종류?)와``My Mother ''는 물론``Wooly Bully ''와``World to see the World ''등이 있습니다. 로얄 런던 필 하모닉 오케스트라가 공연을 시작하면서들은 영화의 주요 주제. ``내 어머니 ''가있는 장면은 여전히 ​​내 눈을 찢습니다. ``Getting Lucky ''라는 노래와 관련하여 처음에는 아무것도 생각하지 않았지만 나이가 들었고 인생에 대해 알게되면 노래가 조금 암시 적이라는 것이 분명해졌습니다. 그 노래와 애니메이터가 Chipettes 팬티의 색을 알고 청중을 주장한다는 사실과 함께. 이것은 엘레노어가 열기구 바구니의 측면에 몸을 기울이고 치마가 중력을 완전히 무시할 때 아라비아 왕자의 남자들이 Chipettes를 쫓아 갈 때 이집트에서 특히 분명합니다. 이것은 영화의 전반적인 품질을 끌어 내지는 못하지만, 왜 세계에서 아무도 4 피트 높이의 다람쥐가 걸어 다니고 놀라 울 정도로 높은 목소리로 말하고 치료한다고 생각하지 않는 것처럼 보이는 이유 중 하나입니다. 인간의 아이처럼 어쨌든, 그 장면 조금 후 Chipettes는 인형에서 다이아몬드를 발견하고 Chipmunks를 찾아 집에 가기로 결정합니다. Janice Karman의 지시는 그녀와 그녀의 남편 Ross Bagdasarian Jr.가 누구보다 캐릭터를 더 잘 알고 있기 때문에이 영화를 완성합니다. 그들은 심지어 Chipmunks와 Chipettes의 목소리를냅니다. 로스는 앨빈과 사이먼 (데이브뿐만 아니라)의 목소리를 맡고 제니스는 모든 칩셋과 시어 도어의 목소리를 맡는다. 여성 성우들이 목소리를내는 남성 캐릭터에 대해 이야기하면 Nancy Cartwright (바트 심슨의 목소리)가이 영화에 등장합니다. 그녀는 매우 작지만 중요한 역할 인 아라비아 왕자의 역할을합니다. 결말은 물론 행복합니다. 사기꾼은 잡히고 느슨한 끝이 묶여 있으며 영화는 어린이, 데이브 및 미스 밀러가 일몰으로 운전할 때 끝납니다. 알빈은 레이스에서 우승 한 것에 대해 100.000 달러의 보상을 얻지 못했다고 불평했습니다. ``ALVIN! ''그리고 화면은 검은 색으로 바래집니다. <br /> <br /> 클래식 결말. 이 영화에 대한 나의 리뷰가 도움이 되었기를 바랍니다.이 영화를 보지 못했다면 시계를 줘 돈 가치가 있습니다. 80 년대의이 향수적인 클래식은 10 점 만점에 10 점을 얻습니다. 우린 지금 믿지 않아요 ''",私は-ほとんどのレビュアーとは異なり-80年代生まれではありませんでした。私は1994年5月14日に生まれました。それにもかかわらず、私の人生は非常に80年代のスタイルでした。他の子供たちがプレイステーションを持っていたとき、私は自分のファミコンなどでゼルダを遊んでいました。このレビューを書いている時点で私はたった15歳ですが、この映画はすでに私の心の中で特別な場所を占めています。私は、80年代の初期の子供時代のせいで、多くのテレビ番組を見たり、他の子供には見られなかった多くの映画を見たりしました。この映画は、その1つであり、最もすばらしい映画の1つでもありました。<br /> <br />それロサンゼルスのアルヴィンセビリア、サイモンセビリア、セオドアセビリア、デビッドセビリアの家から始まります。シマリスの養父であるデイビッドは、ヨーロッパ中を出張しているときに空港に急いで行きます。彼のタクシーはほとんどそこにあり、チップマンクスは彼が荷造りするのを手伝います。彼らが話している間、アルヴィンはデイブとともに来て世界を見たいという意志を表明します（ただし、技術的にはデイブはヨーロッパにしか行かないので、アルヴィンにとっては、明らかにアメリカとヨーロッパだけが「世界」に該当します）。デイビッドはチップマンクスをミラー氏の世話に任せており、男の子たちの不快感の多くになっている。間もなくデイブは空港に向かい、シマリスはミスミラーとともに家に残されます。その後、地元のカフェで、チップマンクスはチペット（ブルターニュ、ジャネット、エレノア）に対して「30日間で世界一周」のゲームをプレイしています。ワニが熱気球を空から食べた後、ブルターニュに負けた後、アルヴィンは誰が本当に世界中でレースに勝つかについてブルターニュとの論争に巻き込まれました。近くのテーブルに座っている2人のダイヤモンド密輸業者、クラウスとクラウディアフルシュティエンは彼らの議論を聞き、彼らのダイヤモンドを世界中に安全に輸送する方法を必要として、子供たちをだまして彼らに届けようと決めました。彼らは世界中でレースをセットアップし、各チームは世界中のドロップオフで人形を自分のように（秘密にダイヤモンドで満たした）預け入れ、相手のチームのように人形を受け取る必要があります（密かに支払いのために満たされた）ダイヤモンド）が「存在していたことを確認」します。優勝チームは100.000ドルの報酬を受け取ります。彼らはこれを行うのは、ジャマル（しばらくの間かかとで熱くなっているInterpolエージェント）が子供だからといって決して疑うことはないと信じているからです（ただし、これは、旅行では子供たちがセキュリティチェックを行う必要はなく、人形についても質問されることはありません。ダイヤモンドを個人的に持っていれば、クラウスもクラウディアもそうではないのではないかと思います。それで、すばらしい冒険が始まります。この映画は古典的であり、誰もがそれを望まない理由はないと思います。それは素晴らしいアニメーションと一流の声の演技を特徴とし、キックアス音楽は言うまでもありません（私のフランス語を許してください：P）。私の好きな曲は間違いなく「ロックンロールの少女と少年」です。それはまた、映画の中で私のお気に入りの瞬間でもあります。その他の注目すべき曲には、「Getting Lucky」（子供向けの映画のようなものだと思いますか？）、「My Mother」、「Wooly Bully」、「Off to see the world」などがあります。ロイヤルロンドンフィルハーモニー管弦楽団のオープニングクレジットで聞いた映画のメインテーマ。 「私の母」のシーンは、まだ涙を流しています。 「Getting Lucky」という曲に関しては、最初は何も考えていませんでしたが、年を取り人生について学ぶと、その曲が少し暗示的であることが明らかになりました。その歌は、アニメーターがチペットのパンティーの色を知っていると聴衆に強く主張するという事実とともに。これは、エジプトのシーンで、アラビア王子の部下にチペットが追われているときに特に顕著です。エレノアが熱気球のバスケットの側面に寄りかかり、スカートが完全に重力に逆らっています。これは映画の全体的な品質から引き出すものではありませんが、世界中の誰もが4フィートの背の高いシマリスが歩き回り、信じられないほど高い声で話し、それらを扱うことに気がつかないなど、説明されていないことの1つです人間の子供と同じように。とにかく、そのシーンの少し後、チペットは人形の中のダイヤモンドを発見し、チップマンクを見つけて家に帰ることにしました。ジャニス・カーマン監督は、彼女と彼女の夫、ロス・バグダサリアン・ジュニアが誰よりもキャラクターをよく知っているので、この映画を完成させます。彼らはシマリスとチペットの声さえします。ロスはアルヴィンとサイモン（そしてデイブ）の声を担当し、ジャニスはオールチペットとセオドアの声を担当しています。ナンシー・カートライト（バート・シンプソンの声）が女性の声優に声をかける男性キャラクターといえば、この映画に登場します。彼女はアラビア王子の役を演じます。これは非常に小さいですが、重要な役割を果たしています。エンディングはもちろんハッピーです。クルークスは捕らえられ、ルーズエンドは結ばれ、映画は子供たち、デイブ、そしてミラーが日没に向かって運転しているときに終了し、アルビンはレースに勝ったために彼の100.000ドルの報酬を得られなかったと不平を言った。 '' ALVIN！ ''と画面が黒くなります<br /> <br />ちなみにクラシックなエンディングです。この映画のレビューがお役に立てば幸いです。この映画を見たことがない場合は、ぜひご覧ください。お金の価値があります。 80年代のこのノスタルジックなクラシックは、10点満点で10点に達します。<br /> <br /> ''トップへのヘディング '私たちは今信じることを決して止めません」
"When I thought I'd finish all year round without giving a movie a ""Bomb"" rating, my friend brought a notorious shit to my house last night. I was afraid to know the worst reputation and was as sacred as I expected. This is a mess made in Mexico called English and produced by K. Gordon Murray. It has terrible sets and effects, and it doesn't work in the North Pole, but rather a little scary elf in the clouds of the universe, rather than a small elf that helps to make a toy, but rather all other groups. St. Children's When Nick sings a terrible holiday song in various languages, the enthusiastic sequence seems to go on forever, watching the monitor showing all the hard-working children. Obviously, this Santa Claus does not comply with child labor laws! <br /> <br /> Eventually we get an unpleasant, red-lighting disciple who travels the devil from hell to earth. Santa's Christmas Eve turns into a nightmare. Watching this movie is an erratic and twisting experience, it has to surprise young children and force Santa Claus and holidays off forever. Oddly enough, the name of Jesus Christ is often mentioned in this Christmas movie, which in some way is horrifying in connection with all the bizarre things going on. This makes my personal list of ""worst movies I've ever seen"" easy, but I'm sure it's not very unique.","A friend brought this notorious horde home at the very moment when I thought I would finish a year without rating a movie ""bomb"".

It has a terrible set and effects, doesn't work in the Arctic, but is from the clouds of space and doesn't have the little elves that help him make toys, but rather a rather scary Santa with all the different groups. It features children from virtually every country. Watching all kiddies work hard while St. Nick sings horrible holiday songs in different languages, the opening sequence that begins to laugh with heartfelt laughs at the monitor seems to last forever without a story. ..

Turn Santa's Christmas Eve round into a nightmare. Watching this movie is a wacky and twisting experience that will scare little kids and definitely turn off Santa Claus and the holidays forever. Oddly enough, the name of Jesus Christ is often mentioned in this Christmas movie. It somehow makes it all creepy in the context of all the strange things that are happening. This will easily create a personal list of ""the worst movies I've ever seen"", but I'm sure it's not unique."
"Much is lost, as is often the case when trying to get a 400 plus page book and turn it into a two hour movie. Director John Madden (Shakespeare of Love) took on a very ambitious project and almost succeeded. What we get is an attractive, emotionally appealing movie that somehow looks imperfect. <br /> <br /> This movie is wonderful and fantastic. The filming by John Toll (cinemagrapher, Oscar of the Blaveheart and Falls of the Falls) is great. Working with Madden, it's great to choose a place on the island of Kefallonia in Greece, and the visual image that comes out when shooting this magnificent place in a variety of light is lush and beautiful. Madden also uses countless Greek actors as villagers to give the village a real feel. The soundtrack is great and the mandolin syllables and vocals of Italian soldiers are great. <br /> <br /> Madden does a great job of bringing us the Italian occupation and romance, which is a big part of the movie. There are countless sweet and fun moments in this section. However, when the serious battle drama was ready to unfold, there were not many films left on the reels, and this component was extremely rushing and abbreviated. The battle scenes went well, but it is clear that more and more compromises are taking place so that the movie does not run too long after the battle is over. When we reach the postwar scene, the treatment is just a skeleton. Another negative point is that DVDs are particularly lean in function. When he has to fight, Cage turns the gear into a man with fierce principles, solves it, and can somehow trust both. In part this is because the cage dominates the screen, but the cruise seems too gentle in areas that have to be emotionally violent and dynamic. She is able to objectively characterize herself. About as natural. However, Christian Bale seems a bit exaggerated and stiff like Pelagia's fiancé. <br /> <br /> This movie was rated 8/10. Despite some shortcomings, this is a moving movie worth seeing.","When you try to pack a book of 400 pages or more into a 2-hour movie, you often lose a lot. Here, director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) takes on a very ambitious project and almost stops it. What we get is a fascinating and emotionally compelling film that somehow seems incomplete. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of great and wonderful things in this movie. Cinematography by John Thor (Braveheart and Legend of the Fall Cinematographer, both Academy Awards) is amazing. Working with Madden, the choice of locations on the Greek island of Kefalonia is great. The visual images that result from shooting these majestic locations in varying light are rich and beautiful. Madden also uses numerous Greek actors as townspeople to give the town a genuine atmosphere. The soundtrack is great, and the mandolin passages and vocals by the Italian soldiers are great. <br /> <br /> Maden brings us Italy's occupation and romance and accounts for most of the film. .. There are many sweet and funny moments throughout this segment. However, by the time the serious battle drama is ready to roll out, there is little film left on the reels, and this component has been omitted very quickly. The battle scene is going well, but it is clear that after the battle, compromises are being made progressively to prevent the movie from being too long. By the time we reach the post-war scene, the cure is simply skeletal. The other drawback is that DVDs have a particularly low functionality. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage is a romantic lead and charming as a sentimental captain who seemed to have joined the army rather than combat. When he had to fight, Cage seamlessly switched gears to a man of fierce principles to settle, and for some reason remains incredible in both personas. This is partly due to the cage dominating the screen, but Cruz seems to be too gentle on the part that is emotionally intense and dynamic. She is able to objectify the character as an interest in Corelli's love, rather than establishing herself as a powerful character. Nature as medicine. However, Christian Bale seems a bit tense and stiff, like his Pelagian fiancee. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie as 8/10. Despite some drawbacks, this is a moving film that is worth a look. The photos alone are worth the entrance fee."

"I have seen Love Jones more than 30 times. It's one of those rare films that depicts a love story about people who have become African Americans. The conversation was realistically written and delivered honestly. It was so good to watch a movie with a storyline centered around young, professional African Americans. This is actually an undeveloped market. Love Jones was visually attractive. The chemistry of Lorenz Tate and Nia Long will bring back memories of past and present love. The film feels like jazz and blues, and a splash of Kahlua and Butterscotch evokes the sensuality of a hot creamy hot chocolate. If you didn't guess, I've liked it!","I have seen Love Jones more than 30 times. It's one of the most valuable works of a love story of African-Americans.

"This is the best movie I have ever seen. At the age of 12 I arrived late for the movie. It was on the American channel Gilbert Godfrey's Up All Night. I will never forget. At the time, my friend and I were really struggling with other problems, some sexual problems. You know that 12 is a very rough and strange me. It seems to be trapped between being a young girl and a young girl. This movie helped answer a lot of questions. I now have a 12 year old daughter. I have been looking for this movie for years. If it comes on DVD, it will be the first one to buy.

Children deserve entertainment too. But Disney is guilty of trying to appeal to a teenage audience, and they usually fail. But it's not a hole. It's a type of movie that anyone of all ages can watch and enjoy, and I never thought it was dirty.

"I can't hate the show. When the old (and better) tech TV hit the bricks, the channel was regrouped and a new show started. ""Show Attack"" replaces the screensaver and initially has three co-hosts. They were Kevin Rose, Kevin Pereira and Sarah Lane. Brendan Moran was also a co-organizer, but mostly played pre-recorded songs for the show.

"Some people may call ""Cooley High"" the same sort of thing as ""American Graffiti"", but I wouldn't. For starters, in ""AG"", everyone was white, collected in ""CH"" they're all black.

"I recently saw this work on DVD. It was my first time since it first aired in 1983, and it was as good as I remembered. At first it seemed to be outdated and I think it's a bit outdated when the BBC series is back. (I miss a fancy costume drama that always seems to have been on a Sunday afternoon.) But it's as perfect as it was next door. I'm a ""Jane Eyre"" purist and I've never seen other faithful works with this book as it's my favorite book. I recently read this book again and some conversation has started. After reading through to the scene where Rochester asked Jane about the appearance of St. John, I found out that their words were accurately reproduced on the screen by Dalton and Clark, perfecting them. <br /> <br /> All of the other works that seemed to do seem to be lacking in some way, and some of them completely eliminate the connection between the ""Rivers"" family and Jane. I also think this is the only work that accurately includes the ""Gypsy"" scene. She looked too old. Timothy Dalton is a bit handsome, but perfectly perfect like Rochester. Describes every aspect of his character correctly and takes off his socks! I agree with the other opinion that the time seems very scary, as in the scene where he slowly walks around in the church when the wedding is stopped. His expression is fantastically scary. But in another favorite scene, when Jane declared that she loved each other, and in the morning Jane descended the stairs and went to his arms, his joy was amazing. A wonderfully portrayed and completely reliable love. Ah, being loved by such a person! There were some strangely missing scenes, such as when Jane went to bed with Helen dying and when Rochester was shopping for Jane's wedding.","Recently I saw this work on DVD. It was the first time I saw it since it was broadcast in 1983, so it was so good that I remembered it.

(I miss the great costume drama that I always had on Sunday afternoon at the time) But that aside, it's as close to perfect as possible. I'm a purist of ""Jane Eyre"", but this is my favorite book and I've never seen another work faithful to this book.

He also agrees with other comments that he sometimes looks pretty dreadful, like a scene that slowly looks back in church when a wedding is interrupted. But in another favorite scene, his delight is great the next morning when they declare love for each other when Jane steps down her arms and crosses her arms. A love that is wonderfully drawn and completely believable. Loved by a man like that! There were some weirdly missing scenes, such as when Jane climbed into bed with Helen dying, or when Rochester did Jane's shopping for her wedding shopping (I was there). I thought I was in, but my memory is probably playing tricks). <br /> <br /> Finally, if you haven't seen another piece of Jane Eyre, just look at this and this is just perfect."
"In a bad time, not a terrible comedy, Queens of Kings is a perfect oxygen tank beyond breathing fresh air! In my opinion it is one of the 5 best comedy shows of all time. Nothing has been so good since I married my children. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are comic genius! Believe me. It takes a lot of time to classify someone as a cartoon genius. These people understand what is really fun. I was able to watch Seinfeld's 10 episodes and I didn't get half of the laughter when I only watched KOQ once. Other interesting people on the show are Carrie, Janet Heffernan, Spence and Doug Pruzan (Carrie's boss). I am very glad they got a lot of seasons in this gem. The show was mostly a fun winner in the era of cartoon defeat.","The King of Queens, if not a terrible or terrible comedy, is not a breath of fresh air, but a complete oxygen tank. In my opinion, it is one of the five best comedy shows ever. It's never been better since I got married to a child. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are comic geniuses! And it takes a lot of time to trust me and let someone be classified as a cartoon genius. These guys understand that it's really interesting. I was able to watch 10 episodes of Seinfeld, never seeing KOQ just once and laughing in half. Other interesting people on this show are Carrie, Janet Hefernan, Spence, and Doug Pleasant (Carrie's boss). I am very happy that they can get many seasons from this gem.

Norman J. Warren's successor SATAN'S SLAVE (1976) was thanks to Max Cuff's amazingly complex script (obviously his only writing). Much more than the sum of the poor parts: Faulkner and Annan indulge Compulsive relationships while living in isolated splendor within the English countryside (alternatively beautiful and sinister renderings by Derek V. Browne's eye-catching cinematography), Annan The discovery of bloody clothes in this upstairs room indicates one of the things that stands out (or both). Psychologically confused love can explain the absence of the family. They appear to have lived at once and are'left' in a mysterious situation. Stokes's unexpected arrival is tense, as Faulkner's pathological masculine hatred is partly attracted to him, creating a violent atmosphere. Stocker's alien spirit can go beyond intended ridicule, but Faulkner has a special multi-layered sequence that tries to'put on' his clueless visitor. <br /> <br /> Initially, at least the relationship between Faulkner and Anan is depicted with rare grace and dignity, but this hearty sapphic contact person is quickly divided into sex and swear words that please the crowd, and Annan is ecstatic about herself. Stokes' ending sequence is (literally) intuitive, especially after Annan's final scene, which appears to have been cut for reasons of censorship in 1977 and seems to have never been fully restored. (Protect yourself because it's still alive!). Warren's inconspicuous three-lead reinforced performance makes the most of the stunning woodland to make up for the film's budget flaws. It was first released in the United States as ALIEN PREY.","PREY <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.37: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> A lesbian couple living in a distant country (with Sally Faulkner The Glory Annan) family is separated by the arrival of a young man (Bally Stokes) who turns out to be a carnivorous alien. A pioneer of a massive invasion... <br /> <br /> Despite its small budget and promising pace, Norman J. Warren's follow-up to SATAN'S SLAVE (1976) was that of Max Cuff. Thanks to a surprisingly complex screenplay (apparently, his only writing credit), it's far more than the sum of the small parts. An obsessive relationship between living in an isolated splendor of the English countryside, alternately beautifully and sinisterly rendered by Derek V.

Annan's discovery of clothes shows one (or both) of these eyes, which may explain the lack of their respective families, psychologically disturbed Lovely, sometime living at home Appears to be leaving, and in a mysterious situation ""left"". The unexpected arrival of Stokes confuses the relationship. This is due to Faulkner's morbid hatred of men and that Annan was attracted to him, causing tension and causing a whirlwind of climax violence. There is an extraordinary multi-layered sequence in which Falksner tries to ""weaken"" him by dressing ignorant visitors in women's clothing, but Stokes's alien spirit rises above his mockery. Makes it possible. <br /> <br /> At least in the early scenes, the relationship between Faulkner and Annan was portrayed with unusual elegance and dignity, but this hearty, uncomfortable liaison quickly gave the crowd sex and coolness.

The final sequence is (literally) a gut wrench. In particular, Annan's last scene was clipped in 1977 for reasons of censorship and didn't seem to have been completely restored (the rest is still vivid, so please hold on firmly). Warren's unobtrusive orientation, with three leads for outstanding performance, maximizes the spectacular forest location, thereby compensating for the film's budgetary shortcomings.

"The tourist season has just begun. Winter begins on an island off the coast of Scotland and both humans and sheep settle in much quieter times. The former British paratrooper, James Warwick, is a local dentist, is not an islander by birth, and his relationship with local artist and mapmaker Celia Imrie has always been a bit of doubt. It's not malicious, but the tight community is moving away from intimate protective instincts. When Gaffikin goes out for a solitary round of golf, the island's tranquility is broken when she discovers the headless wreck of a brutally killed woman. He immediately reports his terrible discovery to Insp Inskip (Maurice Roëves) at the island's police station, and Inskip delivers the artifact to Dr. Goudry, a local GP, for further investigation. Finding a murderer quickly turns out to be fruitless, just like finding a missing local woman. While Fiona is having dinner with Michael Gapikin that night, she realizes that the woman who died could be Shela Anderson from the mainland. A quick search at her home Dove Cottage revealed a house that turned out to be a missing remains of the corpse, a murder scene, but why did the killer drag her body to the forest for more than a mile? Doubt is immediately in doubt as one of the last strangers on the island, Colonel Howard Newth, is one of the last to see her when she comes along on the last ferry. <br /> <br /> Goudry asks. Gaffikin, who has dental expertise on the victim's body, indicates that she has been torn by somebody or with great power. One kind of tooth on the body points to a human killer, and the other to an unknown animal. There is a possibility of being disconnected from and helping, and the radio also doesn't work, so it seems to be blocked and the phone line is disconnected. Reports of UFOs and sightings of camouflaged soldiers have been compounded by discovering strange crafts hidden behind rocks on the beach. Inskip is confused, refuses to listen to facts, and aliens may be involved, but laugh at Gaffikin's idea that the level of radioactivity on the island is rising, making him doubt himself. <br /> <br /> The nightmare is based on David Wiltshire's novel ""The Child of the Vodyanoi"". Co-ordinated by Robert Holmes, and directed by Douglas Camfield, he gained experience in science fiction and classical cinema, and that experience has benefited the film. Genre expert. The Nightmare Man is a more concise and well-made work overall, and even a small character creates a plot with solid character development. The island setting is probably a genre injury that has been around for a long time, but the atmosphere that I enjoy very much, extraneous, and non-compulsive is always added to the atmosphere and an extra is given here to impenetrable fog to hinder all efforts. Imprisoned. In the efforts of many genres of this kind, the procedure is very easy for a stupid plot to rely on a melodrama, but with credit for Camfield, he always focuses on faith. There is authenticity about the process, and the character sometimes speaks in Japanese until this point. If there is a negative point about the murderer, you are given a POV for the murder, an acceptable cliché itself, but overkill and scream when looking through the red filter and fish eye lens. There are some dates in the movie. Nevertheless, given the clues presented, it would be difficult to guess the outcome or identity or guess the species of the killer, but it is a fun and well-behaved work. Local Scottish casts are exceptional, especially the local lobby Roeves and Cosmo are sparring apart. Imrie, which I have never seen in other works, is pretty good and shows the physique of a woman as if she were in a hammer making. An absurd and colossal ending can provoke some viewers, but it disappointed me in some way, but the easy-to-understand and acceptable appendix, considering when it was made, is much scarier if you think about it.",スコットランド沿岸の離島で観光シー​​ズンが終わりました。冬が始まり始め、人も羊も、より静かな時代に先駆けて暮らしています。イギリス軍の元空挺部隊員であるマイケルガフィキン（ジェームズワーウィック）は地元の歯科医であり、出生時は島民ではありません。悪意を持ってではなく、緊密なニットコミュニティが親類のために持っている保護的な直感から脱したものです。孤独なゴルフラウンドのためにガフィキンが残酷に殺された女性の頭のない遺跡を見つけたとき、島々の静けさは壊れています。彼はすぐに彼の陰惨な発見を島の警察署のInsp Inskip（MauriceRoëves）に報告し、Inskipは遺体を地元のGPであるGoudry博士に詳細に検査するように手配します。行方不明の地元の女性を探すのと同じように、殺人犯を素早く探すのは実りがないことがわかります。その夜、マイケルガフィキンと一緒に夕食をとったフィオナは、亡くなった女性が、本土出身の女性、シーラアンダーソンである可能性があることに気づきました。自宅のダブコテージをすばやく検索すると、遺体の遺体が見つかり、自宅が殺人シーンであることが判明しましたが、なぜキラーは胴体を1マイル以上森の中に引き入れたのでしょうか。疑惑はすぐに島に残された1人の見知らぬ人、ハワード大佐（ジョナサンニュース）の1人（最後のフェリーで一緒に遭遇したときに彼女が生きているのを最後に見た人）にかかった。<br /> <br />ガドリーが尋ねるガフィキンは犠牲者の体のいくつかの歯科専門知識について、それが彼女が私の誰かまたは何かを非常に強力に引き裂かれていたことを明らかにします、体の1セットの歯跡は人間のキラーを指しているように見え、別の動物は未知の動物のものを指しているようですある種の。羊が切断されて発見され、カナダの鳥類学者が殺されたのが発見されました。霧が強く降り注いでおり、島は本土から切り離されており、支援の可能性があります。ラジオも機能せず、ブロックされているようで、電話回線が切断されています。 UFOの報告とカモフラージュされた兵士の目撃は、ビーチの岩の後ろに隠された奇妙に見える船の発見によってさらに悪化します。インスキップは混乱しており、事実以外は何も聞くことを拒否し、エイリアンが関与しているかもしれないというガフィキンの考えを笑いながら、島の放射能レベルの上昇は彼を疑わせています。<br /> <br />悪夢の男は小説、デイヴィッドウィルトシャーのチャイルドオブザヴォディアノイに基づいて、フー博士とブレイクの7人の脚本家ロバートホームズによって改作され、ダグラスカムフィールドによって監督されました。ボード上のジャンルの専門家。ナイトメアマンは、全体的には、簡潔に優れた細工が施された作品であり、マイナーなキャラクターまで、しっかりとしたキャラクターの開発とともにプロットを構築しますが、それらすべてにしっかりした背景を与える時間が与えられます。島の設定はおそらく何度も使用されてきたジャンルの決まり文句ですが、私が非常に楽しんでいるのは、その遠隔性、包囲下にいるという感覚、いつも外に出るものはなく、ここに追加されていますすべての努力を妨げるために突き通せない霧を近くに置くことによって、活力を与えます。この種の多くのジャンルの取り組みでは、手続きが愚かになり、陰謀がメロドラマに頼るのは非常に簡単ですが、Camfieldの功績として、常に信憑性に重点を置いてそれをすべて保持しています。手続きについては真正性があり、キャラクターは時々ゲーリックを話し、この点をさらに進めます。そのキラーについての1つのネガティブがある場合、殺害のPOV、それ自体は許容できる決まり文句が与えられますが、赤いフィルターとフィッシュアイレンズを通して見たとき、それは過剰と悲鳴を上げるだけです。映画の日付はほんの少しです。それでも、提示された手がかりを考えると、結果やアイデンティティ、さらに言えばキラーの種を推測するのは難しいでしょうが、それは楽しくて非常によくできた作品です。地元のスコットランドのキャストは並外れており、地元のボビーであるRoevesとCosmoは特にお互いにしっかりとスパーリングしていて、見ていると楽しいです。他の作品で一度も行ったことのないイムリーもかなり上手で、まるでハンマーのプロダクションにいるかのような女性らしい体格を示しています。風変わりな、おそらくは途方もない結末でさえ、一部の視聴者を怒らせるかもしれません。それは、ある意味で私を失望させましたが、それが行われたときを考慮すると、それを考えると、さらに恐ろしいという理解できる許容できる補遺です。
"This review also includes the spoiler for the first movie, so if you haven't seen any movie but don't want the spoiler, don't read this review! <br /> <br /> During this time, the film was about Christian and Catherine meetings for the first time, and the film is a poor copy of the original brutal intention. The actors who portrayed Ryan Phillippe's Christian and Sarah Michelle Gellar's Kathryn are actually very poor substitutes. Also, the attitude of the blatant and stupid rich child that the original actors did cannot be drawn. The fact that the dialogue between Christianity and Catherine is not very active is very convincing. There is a mismatch in the plot. If this is the first meeting of Christian with Catherine, why did the Christian fall in love with the girl after the movie? He is believed to have fallen in love for the first time in the original film (with the character of Reese Witherspoon). <br /> <br /> Alliance with photos / The ""can be a model"" end was completely lame and didn't add at all. Overall, this film was a waste of time. I can't believe they had a brutal intention 3.","This review also includes spoilers for the first movie. So if you haven't seen either movie yet and don't want to spoil or want it, don't read this review! <br /> <br /> During this time the film is to be about Christian and Kathryn meeting for the first time, the film being a poor copy of the first cruel intent. The actors they portrayed Ryan Philippe's Christian and Sarah Michelle Geller's Kathryn are actually a very poor substitute. Neither can elicit the attitude of stubborn, tired and affluent children as the original actor did. It's really scary that part of the conversation was verbatim-not so much between Christian and Kathryn, but if you listen carefully enough, you can recognize it. The conspiracy is also inconsistent-if this was really the first encounter between Christian and Kathryn, why did Christian fall in love with a girl at the end of the film? He was probably supposed to have fallen in love with the original movie for the first time (with the characters of Reese Witherspoon). <br /> <br /> Also, the link with the photo / ""You may be a model"" comment The last one was completely lame and nothing was added.

"This film is nonsense trying to comedy, but the script is terrible. The whole film takes place in the dark and you can't tell that it's a comedy. It's a really bad movie shooting method. You have to sit here and actually watch to realize there is a joke. This is like a drama drama movie that wants to get worse. They are really pointless movies. Unless you get bored from your ass, I suggest you stay away from the gags of the movie.","This movie is ridiculous. I'm aiming for a comedy, but the script is scary. I can't understand the fact that the whole movie takes place in the dark and is a comedy. It's a really bad movie shoot. You really have to sit there and look at it and notice some jokes here and there, but anyway they're all among the jokes among them. It's like an aspiring drama flick that didn't work. It's a really very pointless movie, and their expression reveals only the discouragement and calamity that turns out to be that way. Unless you don't want to get tired of your ass, I recommend leaving the gag of this movie."
"In dramatizing Wilde's novel, John Osborne cleared up the case, removed many characters, and generally hinted rather than showing Dorian's essential evil. See 1945 film for more explicit rendering. Wild and Robert Lewis Stevenson lived at about the same time, but were definitely different men and writers. The story actually covers a topic similar to Stevenson's ""Dr. Jekyll and Dr. Hyde"", but Wild chose to treat his story as a fantasy, but RLS took the scientific path. Both protagonists are men who win against evil and eventually win with evil. John Gielgud says that all the caustic and cynical quips like George Sanders actually project Wilde himself, but there are subtle differences. I doubt that Sanders actually believed what he was saying, but Giel Gud may be telling him what he expects, not sincerely. Peter Firth also shows both sides of his character in a limited way, but he can't see his way out as much as Hurd Hatfield can. <br /> <br /> Good results, dramas are not all ripple effects, but reflect the essential elements of the novel.","In dramaizing Wild's novel, John Osbourne condensed the events, eliminated many characters, and, in general, did not imply Durian's inherent evil. If you need a clearer rendering, watch the 1945 movie. Wild and Robert Louis Stevenson lived at about the same time, but were certainly different men and writers. The story actually deals with a theme similar to Stevenson's “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde”, but Wild chose to treat his story as fantasy, whereas RLS adopted a scientific approach. Please note that you did. Both protagonists are men who have ended the battle with evil and finally won. <br /> <br /> The actors in this BBC movie also take a different route than the 1945 movie. John Gielgud says exactly the same caustic and ironic irony as George Sanders. In his role, he actually projects Wilde himself, but there are subtle differences. You might think Sanders really believed in what he was saying, but Gilgadd might say what he expected, not what he believed in sincerely. Hmm. Peter Firth also shows both sides of his character in a restrained way, but he can't see his escapad as much as Hard Hatfield had the opportunity to exhibit. <br /> <br /> Great production, with drama adaptation that reflects the essence of the novel, if not all of it."
"It starts off as a very serious social commentary where you can quickly think of other Clark movies like Kids, Bully and more. But right away, it goes into a chaos without direction. Who is the main character? Is this a serious movie about a serious movie? Is the skate documentary with the moment of conversation inserted? I have no clue. I looked at the clock and wondered when this shit would end. I thought there would be a great shocking peak that never came. I quickly rolled up a pointless skate scene and cut 20 minutes out of the movie. Yes, it shows a changing landscape between places that are not. First came back. Kids and Bully actually felt like observing the reality of that group of friends. Wassup was very step-by-step, misconfigured, and felt worse. The teenage primitive man Larry instructed without writing was terrible. But at least I thought it was a terrible movie that I didn't take seriously. Wassup Rockers was mediocre.","It starts like a very serious social commentary that immediately reminds me of other Clark movies like Kids and Bree. Who is the main character? Is this a serious movie, or is Greg Araki's question more than the top Goofy movie Is this a skating documentary with a moment of conversation inserted? I have no clue. I was looking at the clock and wondered when this turf would end. I kept thinking that there was a big compilation of shockers that didn't come. Fast-forwarding a meaningless skating scene cut 20 minutes of the movie. Yes, it shows a landscape that changes between what you have and what you don't. I got it first. Kids and Breeze was done in such a way that it felt like I was actually observing the reality of that group of friends. Wassup was very well-directed, poorly structured and badly acting. The teenage caveman, who Larry did not write, but wrote directly was terrible. But at least it felt like it was a horrifying movie that didn't take it seriously. Wasap Rockers was terribly bad."
"This is my first Deepa Mehta movie. I watched a movie on TV where the character ""Sita"" in the Hindi version was presented as Nita. Also, it's Radha who tried the fable in the film, not Nita/Sita. However, what I liked about the movie was not her instructions, but a script from Mr. Mehta. The characters, large and small, were well-developed and seemed taut at the end, such as the end of Mazursky's ""An Unriried Woman."" They are brave women surrounded by cardboard men. And it seems that one cardboard man (subgenus) survived the scene we last saw. He seems to finally take responsibility for the future beyond singleness and observance of religion. <br /> <br /> Mr. Meta doesn't seem to be a director (she seems to look great when compared to most Indian mainstream films), but she goes beyond the subtle co-family that uses script to present except for the presentation. Should not. A glimpse of China's ethnic minorities in the Indian social environment. She dedicated the movie to her mother and daughter (not her father). However, her Radha, with her parents in the mustard field, brought back memories of the rock age. Her Mr Mr. Compared to Sen, Adoor Gopalakrishnan and Muzaffar Ali, she is dwarfed by Canada's competent Canadian production team and giants who have been provided financial resources! Mehta's film about two bisexual women in an Indian middle class family captures the atrophy of a middle class family who may be a victim to some, but not aspire to something better than immediate survival in a limited social space. Kannada, Malayalam, and Bengali films influenced the parallel theme of India, but there was no publicity surrounding this film, so movie theaters with extensive knowledge could not see it. <br /> <br /> Ms Das, Ms Azmi Jafri and Kharb anda are reliable, but not excellent. Mrs. Azmi is a talented actress who has performed well in great directors (""Khandar"" by Marine Sen, ""Paar"" by Gautam Ghose, ""Ankur"" by Benegal). Das flashed because the screen existed, not the acting function. In general, the strength of the film remains a structure of higher than average scenarios in terms of international film. Mehta is confident that you can hone your writing talent in future scenarios.","This is my first deep meta movie. I watched the Hindi version of the movie on TV and announced that ""Theta"" character as Nita. I also note that it was Lada that was not the Nita/Theta, but the allegorical trial by fire in the film. Still, what I liked about this movie was Mr. Meta's script, not her director. The character was well developed, large and small, and looked strange towards the end. It seems like the end of Mazursky's ""Unmarried Woman"". They are brave women surrounded by cardboard men. And it seems that one cardboard man (Ashok) is reviving with his inactive mother's busy on the last shot we see him. He seems to be finally responsible for the future beyond singleness and faith. <br /> <br /> Mehta seems to be a mess as a director because he can't do anything other than directing (although compared to most Indian mainstream movies, it looks amazing. ). Part of China's microminority in the Indian social environment. She dedicates the film to her mother and daughter (not her father!). Still her Lada recalls the days of Halcyon in Mustard Field with her parents. Comparing her with Mrinal Sen, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, and Muzaffar Ali, she is a midget to these giants-given her talented Canadian production team and financial resources! Mehta's film of two bisexual women in an Indian middle-class household may be a sacrifice to some, but better than immediate survival in a limited social space. It simply captures the shrinkage of middle-class homes that seem undesired. Although Kannada, Malayalam, and Bengali films touch on parallel themes in India, they were not seen in the broad segment of knowledgeable filmmakers, as there was no publicity surrounding the film. <br /> <br /> Ms Das, Ms Azmi, Jafri and Kharbanda are credible, but not outstanding. Azumi is a talented actress who performed brilliantly under excellent directors (“Khandar” from Minarsen, “Paar” from Gautam Horse, “Ankur” from Venegal). Das shined because of the presence of the screen, not his acting ability. Overall, the strength of the film lies in its above-average screenplay composition from an international film perspective. Mehta can improve her writing talent with her future scripts."
"I thought, ""Oh, why!"" At first I thought ""maybe exactly average"" but the acting and conspiracy in most parts was terrible. <br /> <br /> The first movie was a big similarity to the ring, it was about half the movie, but this brought all the good things about the first one and looked terrible. For example, everyone in the audience made themselves wet. The part where Geller has fallen from the building is stitched. My girlfriend had to keep telling me to keep quiet, and she kept mentioning what would happen next, and it was more correct than less time. I don't understand. It wasn't an excuse for a lot of murder, and in fact, it didn't show any depth at all. <br /> <br /> You can see everything coming. Oh, behind her... I didn't see one coming * yawning *. <br /> <br /> These people must have thought ... Oh, I don't know, fight at least not with a head instead of holding a knife or at least someone. At best in the movie, I was very lightly frightened (meaning light), and I thank them, ""God."" ""If you haven't, don't waste your time and money.","I had been thinking about it for a long time, and I thought, ""What the heck!"" At first, I thought, ""Yes, it would be average."" <br /> <br /> The first movie was very similar to the ring and it was a half decent movie, but this took all the good stuff of the first one and made them look awful It was A few bits have everyone in the audience wet themselves, for example. The part where Geller falls from the building sewed me together. My girlfriend had to tell me to be quiet, I kept commenting on what would happen next, and many times I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Why does she come after you when you enter the house, it doesn't make sense. It wasn't an excuse for many of the killings, and no real depth was seen. <br /> <br /> I can see everything, so I didn't feel it was just looking. Oh, she's behind her... I didn't see that guy yawning. <br /> <br /> Surely these guys must have been thinking...oh, I don't know, try to fight back someone's hair rather than carry a knife or at least eat Is it? At the very end of the film, I was scared very calm (meaning softly) at best. Just yelling for credit, they rolled and spewed a short ""Oh thank god"". If you haven't already, don't waste your time and money. No sense, don't plot much, sorry for the regret!"

Mark Hamill depicts the future bounty hunter, and Bill Paxton is his quarry. Paxton's character hijacked Hamil's prisoner, an android named after the poet Byron (Bob Peck). Tasker (Hamill) shoots Owens (Paxton) with a dart containing a tracking device, allowing him and his fellow Belitski (Kitty Aldridge) to maintain the pair. But the real question is why he just fired the device at Byron and didn't cut off the intermediary. Here you find something interesting. But I can't convince me that this movie makes sense at any level. The future Stone Age scene gives way to the folklore of the higher societies, but when Paxton's character appears throughout his torso with Hicky after the night's delight, he becomes the pinnacle of bad taste. Reach If anyone thinks there's a hidden meaning here, you're really stretching. <br /> <br /> Sadly, the patient was waiting for the frame that declared the ""end"" to be visible. If there is beauty in the eyes of the viewer, I understand it. There was neither in this movie. Still, once the final credit was executed, there was one redemption feature. Great view of half a dozen hot air balloons. Apparently the movie kept them floating."
"Experienced visually comedy director Edward Sedgwick successfully leads the Ro Roach road show, using many of Roach's trusted performers to move fast, show tricky scenarios and outstanding casting.

Music comedy featuring Broadway headliner Lyda Roberti. Laurel and Hardy offer some enjoyable interludes, including the well-known skeet with a little harmonica, and see great spins like Joyce Compton, Russell Hicks and Walter Long.

"This slasher photo has been sold by date, but this card is fun. <br /> <br /> The Valentine card itself is witty and well thought out. <br /> <br /> This peach has one peach. Watching Buffy's rerun when he's actually an angel, ""He's not an angel..."" would never be the same!

"The only reason I made ""Horror Masters"" Episode 1 2 instead of 1 is because the two actors were great and didn't fit VHS.

"Most of the time, I thought of'another crocodile movie'. So far we've had Primeval and Rogue in the past 12 months. What's new? Both films were about action and violence, but this is about fear and tension. Too much is like torture. There's a hole in the plot, and as others have pointed out, the crocodile doesn't actually behave this way, but the fear is so effective that you will enjoy this movie. It will leave you as uncomfortable as the passion of Christ.","Like most, I thought of ""another crocodile movie"". So far, there have been Primeval and Rogue in the last 12 months, what can they do?

"There are some prior comments on the clichéd story of this film. And I fully agree with the character regarding the conversation. <br /> <br /> I read Elizabeth Berkeley's horrible story. A performance in the same horrible ""Showgirls"" I've never seen.. Her performance is not terrible, but rarely meets the standard of Lifetime's worse fare. There was no hint of depth in her personality, but maybe you shouldn't. There was no hint (not tracking) for depth or charisma in the actor or portrayal, so the film was out of balance. <br /> <br /> After Principal's kiss in the hallway, Liz's initial complaints could be laughed. Her husband's initial reaction and advice were similar (Forrest Gump attacked Jenny's boyfriend in the car was more realistic and intelligent, and he suffered mentally). The father of the lying student actually did what he deserved to praise in his performance. He could laugh and at the same time be annoying. Her lawyer was a more senseless, nerd, unknown to the profession. <br /> <br /> Finally (and honestly, I enjoyed this part), the police are a collection of meaningless oats. Rather, rely on Barney Fife without Andy to handle all law enforcement and investigations in the community. I know that most real police are a bit lacking in the level of clarity, intelligence and empathy displayed by most characters in the ""Law and Order"" series. However, donuts at this level are essential for ""lifetime"". <br /> <br /> Finally, I found a sort of ""story in the story"" with Josh's consent to his teacher's ""victim."" This scripted performance within the story was much worse than his overall performance in the main story. This was the same thing as going from ""F"" to ""F- minus"". <br /> <br /> This lame situation would have been resolved after a realistic meeting in about 15 minutes of the actual meeting. Between husband and teacher and school authorities. However, that blocked the drama at bay and left an hour's worth of blank movies on the camera. <br /> <br /> But the writer could prove to be worse, as it proved to be an ending. When the situation was finally ""solved"" and ""right"", this was done for about 45 seconds, and in what ""real"" context for the abuser and his parents, what action would be taken, or they could find a way to redemption? . <br /> <br /> This is a 2 * presentation. This is because the second ""*"" has some ""fascination"".","Here are some previous comments that commented on the rich cliché of this flick-and I agree completely, both in terms of characters and dialog. <br /> <br /> It's terrible about Elizabeth Berkley.I've never seen an equally terrible showgirl performance and her performance here isn't terrible, but Lifetime Almost never reached the standard of bad fare. There was no hint of depth in her character, but perhaps it shouldn't be. If so, the film would not have been perfectly balanced, as there was no evidence of depth or charisma (not traces) in one character, performer, or depiction. <br /> <br /> The treatment of Liz's first disgruntled principal after her tutor kissed her in the hall laughed. The first reaction and advice of her husband was similar (Forrest Gump, attacking Jenny's boyfriend in a car, offered a more realistic and intelligent action, and in hell he mentally I was challenged). (Joke) The lying father of the student actually performed a perhaps praiseful act. He was laughable and completely annoying, but not an average feat. Both of her lawyers were insensitive geeks and were unknown to the profession. <br /> <br /> Finally (and frankly, I enjoyed this part), the police were a cordless off-leaf collection. Rely on Bernie Fife, without Andy, to handle all law enforcement and investigations in the community. Most real-life cops know that they are a little less than the level of sharpness, intelligence, and empathy that most characters in the Law and Order series show, but at this level, A standard ""lifetime"". <br /> <br /> Finally, I found a kind of ""story in story"" appeal to Josh's ""victim"" of his teacher. The performance of this script in the story was even worse than his overall performance in the main story. This was like an achievement, moving from an “F” to an “F minus”. <br /> <br /> This real-life problem should actually have been resolved in about 15 minutes after the real-life meeting. Husbands are involved between teachers and school authorities. But it would have eliminated an unnatural drama with it and left a one-hour blank film on the camera. <br /> <br /> However, the writer here proved with the ending. When the situation was finally ""solved"" and ""solved"" this was achieved in about 45 seconds all. It is possible that what was done in the ""real world"" situation of the perpetrators and their parents, or they could find some way towards reimbursement. <br /> <br /> This is a 2* presentation. The second ""*"" is because it has a calm ""charm."""
"If you haven't seen it yet, you should put it on DVD. I can't believe how much I enjoyed it! Surprisingly realistic and reliable. In fact, many of them are being guessed, and I wanted to know more about the speculative and proven facts (but not many), but it does everything well with the ""Cruel Mother Nature"" theme.

You will actually find cheering on some of them and others. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, the effect is great. Sometimes they will look too similar to CGI, but you can look at them from different angles to make them look more realistic. In some cases, you can be sure that you actually saw a dinosaur.

"Many reviews and comments I read about this film say that this is Clara Bow's rather old film and performance. The storyline was somewhat typical of Clara's later silence, but I'm still a little waved and surprisingly fun. Clara plays a happy lucky Hawaiian girl. This girl will not stop where she can beat her loved one. Clara's lack of humility was shocking that day. However, I think it is suitable for the sweetness of movies and general fun. Not a gorgeous storyline (actually typical), but this movie is Clara's great show that makes the audience laugh","Many of the reviews and comments I've read about this movie say it's a fairly old movie and performance by Clara Bow.

"The number of video nasties is still declining, but this small pile of garbage has appeared in the ""Rent"" list when you see it available. <br /> <br /> The premise is something that is taken by the fashion model or hijackers and taken to the jungle. Another guppy is hired to bring her and given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip, but when she comes back to the girl and all the money, she gets a significant cut. He brought a helicopter and a pilot, who is one of the worst actors! Of course, they are all terrible and dubbing will make the blood cry. After stealing into the jungle, we learn that the god, the Earth slaughtering nearby, is a cannibal worshiper who wanders through the woods like the human king Hong Kong and seeks to devour and devour tribal women. Now, this friend is just a naked man with the worst makeup. You can do that with a table tennis ball in your eye. His growling and moaning features are always featured in the soundtrack, and I've found muting much of the scene. <br /> <br /> Oh, forgot to mention almost constant nudity? The scene where God attacks the girl and pulls out her intestines is about a second, but this is probably the main reason the film was banned. However, it is not a limiting factor for Gore fans. Also, Jess Franco goes beyond the usual T and A to show long close-ups and sadly males of the female genitalia. So if you want ""fair"" in terms of exploitation, you can tell. <br /> <br /> This garbage is not recommended to anyone. Not even bad bad movies.

Those two scenes made me cringe! Janeane's character is sickeningly arrogant (and guessing from her role as stand-up ""comedienne"" and arch-feminist is in real life too). She claims that the film is ""anti-feminist"" when in fact it's just realistic. Men more often than not go for looks over personality.It's interesting to note her hypocrisy too. She'd been a feminist and ""comedienne"" for years before taking this role and then suddenly decides afterwards that the film was bad.I imagine she hated the idea and script of this film before it was released but she made sure she kept that quiet so she could get paid for this travesty of a film.I mean come on! She acted in it for Heaven's sake! What this film was really was anti-men if anything.It portrays men as stupid animals whose brains are in their groins with the men doing stupid things to attract the attention of Uma Thurman's character Noelle.<br /><br />There are other bad things about this film too like Ben Chaplin's character being the British man every American girl finds cute and Jamie Foxx being the token black best friend of Chaplin and of course Foxx had to try and mimic his accent a few times for good measure.Is that the best the script writers could come up with? Blimey they've never done that before except with every Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore fil There's also a truly awful phone sex scene which is just grotesque and proves how cheap the film is. The other comments on here all say how Janeane Garofalo isn't ugly but is actually beautiful. Erm was I watching the same film as they were? She's certainly no looker and the only good thing about this film was that she was rightly cast as the ugly one. Although having said that, I fail to see the appeal of Uma Thurman as well: she's lanky and gaunt looking. <br /><br />I guarantee three things about this film if you've never watched it:<br /><br />You will know what the ending will be;<br /><br />You will find the phone sex scene painfully embarrassing and;<br /><br />You will be bored after ten minutes.<br /><br />Watch at your own peril.","I knew this movie because Jewish Ben Chaplin from Game On was in the film. Game On is an entertaining British home comedy and he seems to have left because he wanted to break into Hollywood and star in this movie. He failed to thank God. <br /> <br /> The film is a very simple romantic comedy, in which Jane Garofalo plays an ugly woman. I'm dating Ben Chaplin using her neighbor Uma Thurman. ugly. This movie is just bad for many reasons. Plots are incredibly predictable, from bits of fluttering, such as outright, to bits of muddy, such as serious. A montage that all three enjoy and a bit of a photo. These two scenes made me tired! Janeane's personality is disgustingly arrogant (and I guess her role as a stand-up ""comedienne"" and the arch feminist in real life). She claims that the film is ""anti-feminist,"" even though it's actually realistic. Men often go out in appearance rather than personality. It's interesting to note her hypocrisy. She was a feminist and ""comedian"" for many years before playing this role, but then suddenly decided that the film was bad. I think she hated the movie's ideas and screenplay before it was released, but she kept it quiet so she could pay for this weirdness in this quiet movie. Come on! She acted on it for heaven! It was rather anti-male that really had this movie. It depicts a man as a stupid animal with a brain in the groin, along with a man doing stupid things to get the attention of Uma Thurman character Noel. <br /> <br /> There's another bad thing about this movie, like the Ben Chaplin character, the British feel cute for any American girl, and Jamie Foxx is Chaplin's black best friend Of course, Fox had to try and imitate his accent a few times. Is it the best scripter can come up with? Blimey They have never done that, except for all the movies that Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore have ever made. Just grotesque, there is also a really terrible phone sex scene that proves how cheap the movie is. All other comments here say that Janeane Garofalo isn't ugly but really beautiful. Um, did I watch the same movies as they did? She was certainly ugly, and the only good thing about this movie was that she was cast correctly as ugly. However, I didn't understand the charm of Uma Thurman. She has a faint and rugged face. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie, we guarantee three things: <br /> <br /> You know what the ending will be. <br /> <br /> The phone sex scene is painfully embarrassing and <br /> <br /> gets bored after 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Look at your own danger."

"When I just saw Walt Disney's The Skeleton Dance on a Saturday morning blog linked from YouTube, using the same source, I made a remake for the Columbia Comics unit in Technicolor and was animated by the same man-Ub Iwerks. Compared to early black and white, colors are actually used here, and when one of the skeletal band players consistently hits the wrong note or loses the head and loses the head of another, dancing with the other as part of another fragment is as much as the previous one. It's fun. It almost repeats. Nevertheless, Skeleton Frolics was able to tackle this with the early Silly Symphony.","I just saw Walt Disney's Skeleton Dance on Saturday Morning blog linked from YouTube, so I used the same source to do it in Colombia's comics unit Technicolor and was animated by the same person, Ub Iwerks. I saw a remake. Compared to the previous black and white, colors were used here in a truly imaginative way, when one of the skeletal band players always made the wrong sound, or when one lost his head and left another. When or when alone, the dance of another person, like a new gag, dances with some of the other person. It's as interesting as the previous short story. It will be repeated a little at the end. Still, Skeleton Frolics is definitely worth a look for animation enthusiasts who want to compare this with the older Silly Symphony."
"The cast of this film includes some great New Zealand actors. There are a lot of people that have played a wonderful role, but this movie is full of deep shame that I am from the same country as me. The fake American accent is the first clue that things will go wrong.

Most of the cast appears to be from the long-lasting New Zealand soap Shortland Street.

"Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson are together. Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett ended the role of supporting Foursome's lies and conspiracy. But the essence of all this is that each person maintains a moral conscience despite obvious contradictions. ""Contradiction is the source of all movement and all life."" Watson's Anne Manning is at the heart of the plot. She is the central conscience held by the other three. She is unknown. <br /> <br /> The situation of lies is theirs, one is pending due to pressure from family/partners and one simply does not want to face the consequences;. Ironically, it is a lie to believe the truth and seek friendship. These are all dangerous situations. It is interesting to see how each deals with this truth and lies. Actually contradiction. It seems dishonest, but dignity and mind remain strong. <br /> <br /> The treatment of related topics and the way each person acts are communicated clearly and simply. The other film ""Where the Truth lies"" is not as sensual and complex as in 2005. Credits from Fellows' writings and subtle performances from Watson and Wilkinson. On the surface, there is warmth through bold faces or stuffy hidden lies. Under all that, human frailty was not excluded, and they meant well. And the transition of events along with the story provided satisfaction and a smile for how the relationship between the two Mannings grew and matured. <br /> <br /> You can say there are no obvious action dramas or thrilling scenes in ""Separate Lies,"" but the plot is there and will catch your attention.

Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett end their role in supporting lies and conspiracy foursome. Yet at the heart of everything, each character maintains its line of decency-the moral conscience is retained despite apparent contradictions. “Inconsistency is the source of all movement and all life.” These words are true. Watson's Unmanning is at the heart of this plot-she's the central conscience that the other three were caught in. She is a man of decency. <br /> <br /> Each lie situation is unique. One is to protect your occupation name. Those who withhold due to family/partner pressure; they just don't want to face consequences. Ironically, we can't believe the truth and we lie to save our friendship. These are all unstable situations. There is a conspiracy there, and it's fascinating to see how each one deals with the truth and lies. Certainly a contradiction. Despite the disgrace, decency and heart remain strong. <br /> <br /> The handling of related subject matter and the behavior of each character are beautifully and simply transmitted. It's neither sensational nor complex like the other 2005 film, Where the Truth Lies. Credits by Fellows' writing and subtle performances by both Watson and Wilkinson. The seemingly bold face and the lie hidden by frustration make me feel warm. Under all that, human frailty was not ruled out, they often meant. And, following the story, the turning point in the event provided satisfaction and a smile on how the two Mannings seemed to grow and mature in their relationship. <br /> <br /> There is no clear action drama or thrilling scene in ""Separate Trie"", but there is a conspiracy and it will attract attention.

"I was amazed at the review for this movie. The only place that tells the truth is RottenTomatoes.com. This movie is terrible. The plot is very lazy. It's not scary.

"It wasn't until I looked at the quiz section where I found out that the original creator/star of the movie Tyrone Power died during the production process. This undoubtedly explains why everyone on the screen seems to have their minds about something else, and the symptoms appear in early scenes involving battles that can be portrayed as pathetic.

Well, the appearance of wielding a sword when the combatants persuaded them convincingly <br /> <br /> His conspiracy is centered around Queen Shiva and Solomon king of Israel. His people are not happy about it. I can't blame them because there are few more beautiful things in the world than Israeli Motechs, but all Israeli women look like Cherry Blair!

Canyon in front of them. Even though the Egyptians spend 10 minutes towards the Israelites, they never realize that they are running towards the open canyon! Isn't this a bit illogical? It's also an obvious error because people in horses, tanks, and canyons are clearly miniature figures. <br/> <br/> Anyway, the movie ends with Solomon killing his dangerous brother and praising God for his victory.

"I'm a huge Woody Allen fan, so I couldn't help myself when I saw this playing in the cinema. I love Alan's epic movie Match Point GB with his new muse Scarlett Johanson (a unique feature of Alan's work). The scoop is much lighter than the MP and humor is the most enjoyable aspect of the scoop. The plot is centered around Johansson's personality (journalism student), who gets information about hot stories from beyond the grave. She must fall in love with a suspected serial killer (Jackman) and decide if it is worth finding the truth. Oh, and all of this is done with the help of a detective transforming a magician played by Allen. <br /> <br /> I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed Johanson's performance, but I am a bit prejudiced. I keep a fascination by filming with Johansson. She plays a kind of capricious, stupid and bumpy lover in the sense of Allen's stereotypical character. She adds appropriate body language for the cartoon effect. Needless to say, Johansson's character is sickly cute and there is nothing to add. <br /> <br /> Alan is Alan. Something that happens in this movie I wonder if I will see the nervous little hypochondriac again. He didn't appear in his next photo, and he spent more time exclusively behind the camera lately... <br /> <br /> Jackman is also delighted as a millionaire murder suspect. I can't say that Jackman does nothing specifically to play his role, but it's less suited to his personality. <br /> <br /> On the plot side, I can't think of this as fresh... but the scorpion's curse stinks. Johanson and Allen are more like detectives than anything else. But I have to applaud Allen for his ending because I'm a bit smarter than the typical Hollywood version of his movie. Everything is not black and white, the objects are painted in shades of gray. Being completely innocent has nothing to do with it, and there is no apparent guilt. The plot is old, but Woody still has a tip for one liner. I found his hints about his last movie interesting. Laugh for humor. And rejoice If you don't see anything else...","I'm a big fan of Woody Allen, so when I saw this playing in the cinema, I couldn't help myself.

Oh, all this was done with the help of the detective who became the mysterious magician played by Allen. <br /> <br /> I have to say I fully enjoyed Johansson's performance, but I was a bit biased so I was able to watch it for 3 hours filming with Johansson , Continue to be fascinated. She plays a crazy, talkative, noisy lover, a variation on the senses of Allen's stereotyped neurotic character. She adds proper body language for comic effects. Needless to say, most people who have seen this feel that Johansson's character is disgustingly cute, which is a plus. Something has happened in this movie, so I'd like to see the little hypochondriasis of neurosis again. He is spending more time just behind the camera, not in the next photo cast...<br /> <br /> Jackman is a mouth-watering, millionaire murder suspect. Is fun as It can't be said that Jackman is doing anything special to play his part, but he is still fit for his personality. <br /> <br /> In terms of conspiracy, I have to feel this is fresh... in fact it stinks of the Jade Scorpion's curse. Johansson and Allen seem to be detectives above all. But we have to praise Allen's ending. It's a bit smarter than the typical prominent Hollywood version of the movie. Instead of being all black and white, things are painted in shades of gray. Being completely innocent has nothing to do with it, and no clear guilt. The plot looked old, but Woody still has the talent for one liner. I found his implications for his last movie interesting...come for humor, laugh and cheer. <br /> <br /> Look at it, let alone say if you enjoy Allen's work. If you don't see anything else..."
"I borrowed this movie because of my interest in American history, especially the somewhat strange story of Mormons. The film attempts to understand how Joseph Smith can turn his ""vision"" into a major world religion. It first focuses on the difficulties Mormons faced when they settled in Nauvoo, Illinois. Describe the ordeal of Joseph Smith. During the trial, Brigham Young talked about his conversion to Mormonism and faith in Smith's spiritual message. Then Smith is assassinated and the Spirit must deal with his doubts as to whether Mormon was chosen to lead the new land. Despite his serious doubts, he has a vision that perseveres and finally gives confidence in the legitimacy of his leadership (that Utah is a colonial place). Later, as the crops were destroyed by crickets, he doubted that he was actually chosen, but a miracle occurred, consolidating his position in history. A persuasive and interesting story. I want to know if Mormon thinks this is an accurate description. Polygamy is part of the story, but there is no reason why it is at the heart of LDS. This issue is not emphasized. <br /> <br /> I'm sure people will be far from this movie because of religious themes.","I was interested in American history and borrowed this film because of a rather strange story of Mormons.

"""Frightmare"" in 1983 is a strange little film. The director seems to be trying to combine the atmosphere of a classic '30s/40s style horror movie with the impact factors of the explosive 80s slasher genre at the time. Although not entirely successful (mainly due to budget constraints and less professionalism than a young actor's job), there are still moments due to its advanced performance (higher than the value of the movie). German actor Ferdinand Mayne plays the old old horror movie star (Ala Vincent Price) called ""Conrad Ratzoff."" At the beginning of the movie, we already met a horror star when he filmed an advertisement for dentures, and we quickly find out that ol' Conrad is a little sacred, prima donna jerk-off. When he thought he was no longer fit, the commercial director praised Conrad for blowing the take for 10 hours, and the old goat pushed him off the balcony and died. Good? Conrad visited some fans of the college campus horror movie club, but unfortunately suffered a heart attack during the speech and was eventually waiting to die in the mansion. He still suffered at Death's door, and eventually he was able to suffocate him with a pillow before kicking the bucket, avoiding a relationship with a despised business associate. Conrad relaxes in a true Hollywood style in a state-of-the-art neon tomb with a video screen above the box and plays a personal video message for visitors who visited to pay Conrad's own homage. <br /> <br /> It was at this point that the children of the University Horror Movie Society decided to visit Conrad's tomb a few hours later, to break into the tomb and take the body home for a party all night. . No.) College students eat dinner with Conrad's body in the evening, sit in an honorable place, take pictures and pose. It danced around the room before planning to return him to the crypt in the morning before parking Conrad and his coffin in the attic. Meanwhile, Ratzoff, confused about her husband's theft, urged a psychic friend to ""ask"" Conrad abrasions. You can almost find out the rest here. Conrad wasn't a very good person in life, so it's not that easy to think he won't be more familiar when he dies. After contacting Conrad, the Psychic Lady wakes up in a fashion, as expected, then picks up the young grave robbers one by one, wandering the hallways of the student's incredibly large home for the rest of the film. This is where movies are scattered. Endless teenage scenes roaming the empty hallway say, ""Hello, who is there?"" Before the last two survivors finally figured out (sometimes before the semi-intelligence people noticed the same thing, there was a horrible assault scene... but again, we're in a horror movie of the '80s!) The only way is to return Conrad's body back to the pit there. Slow pacing is filled with strange lighting and dry ice fog effects backed by soundtracks consisting of almost all sound effects (thunder, moaning and moaning, howling, etc.), not music. <br /> <br /> ""Frightmare"" is not recommended for people who have never grown up watching a movie like this on a late night 80s cable. Fans of ""Modern Horror"" will undoubtedly find ""Frightmare"" moving incredibly slow and discovering goofy. But if you're old for the magic 10 years, you can evoke nostalgia in ""Frightmare"". The Coms of Jeffrey fans (""Re-Animator"") may also want to check out the comb as the future Dr. West plays an early role as one of the unfortunate film students. Readers who avoid the version of this movie on the EastWestDVD label (paired with Roy Ward's ""Vault of Horror"" and sold in the dollar store) because the print quality is terrible. I have heard that the movie has received deluxe movies from the great people of Troma. If you are a Troma type person, ""Frightmare"" will be right in your alley.",1983年の「Frightmare」は奇妙な小さな映画です。監督はクラシックな30年代/ 40年代スタイルのホラー映画の雰囲気と、当時爆発していた80年代の斬新なジャンルの衝撃要因を組み合わせようとしているようです。それは完全に成功しているわけではありません（主に非常に明白な予算の制約、および若い俳優のキャストの専門的でない能力による）が、それは主に上品なパフォーマンス（映画よりも上品）のため、その瞬間があります「コンラッド・ラッツオフ」と名付けられた老朽化した昔のホラー映画スター（ヴィンセント・プライス）を演じる故ドイツの俳優フェルディナンド・メインによって。映画の冒頭で、彼が義歯のコマーシャルを撮影しているときに、私たちはホラースターになったホラースターに出会い、ol 'Conradは一家同好のプリマドナジャークオフであることがすぐにわかります。あなたが彼がこれ以上好まないはずがないと思ったとき、コマーシャルディレクターはコンラッドを空腹感を吹き飛ばしたと非難し、古いヤギが彼をバルコニーから追い出して死にました。いいですねその後、コンラッドは大学のキャンパスホラー映画クラブのファンを訪問しましたが、あいにく、彼は演説の最中に心臓発作を起こし、結局彼の邸宅で死ぬのを待っています。死の玄関でさえも活発ですが、彼は最終的に自分でバケツを蹴る前に、軽蔑されたビジネスアソシエイトを枕で窒息させることでなんとかしました。コンラッドは、棺の上にビデオスクリーンを備えたハイテクネオンの墓で真のハリウッドスタイルで休むようになっています。これにより、敬意を払って入場した訪問者に対してコンラッド自身からの個人的なビデオメッセージが再生されます。<br /> <br />それこの時点で、大学のホラー映画協会の子供たちは、コンラッドの墓に時間外訪問をし、墓に侵入し、彼の体を彼らと一緒に徹夜パーティーに連れて行くことにしました。 （ちょうど私の楽しみのアイデアではありませんが、ねえ、これらは80年代のホラー映画の登場人物です。ロジックはここには場所がありません。）大学の子供たちは夕方を過ごし、コンラッドの遺体を名誉ある場所に座って写真を撮ります。コンラッドと彼の棺を屋根裏部屋に駐車する前に、朝に彼の地下室に戻ることを計画しています。一方、夫の遺体の盗難に取り乱したラッツォフ夫人は、霊魂の友人に呼びかけ、婚約を通してコンラッドに「手を差し伸べる」ように呼びかけました。ここから残りの部分をほとんど理解できます。コンラッドは人生であまりいい人ではなかったので、彼が死んで友好的ではないと仮定するのはそれほど難しいことではありません。サイキックレディはコンラッドと連絡を取り、予想通りに目を覚まして再び目覚め、その後、映画の残りの部分を生徒たちの途方もなく巨大な家の廊下を散歩し、若い墓盗人を一人ずつ拾い上げます。ここで映画がバラバラになります。 「こんにちは？誰かいますか？」最後の2人の生存者が最終的に理解する前に、暴力の爆発的なバースト（映画のハイライトであるかなり粗末な断頭シーンを取得します）が中断されます（準インテリジェントな人々が同じことを理解するよりもずっと遅れます）。 ..しかし、再び、私たちは80年代のホラー映画にいます！）騒乱を止める唯一の方法は、コンラッドの遺体をそれが属する地下室に戻すことです。ゆっくりとしたペースは、多くの奇妙な照明とドライアイスフォグ効果で埋め尽くされています。サウンドトラックは、音楽ではなくサウンド効果（雷、うめき声​​とうなり声、遠吠えなど）だけで構成されており、しばらくすると深刻な迷惑になります。 。<br /> <br /> 'Frightmare'は、80年代の深夜ケーブルでこのような安い映画を見て育ったことがなかった人には、本当にお勧めできません。 「モダンホラー」のファンは、間違いなく「Frightmare」の動きが非常に遅く、間抜けであることに気付くでしょう。ただし、その魔法の10年間で成人した場合、「Frightmare」からノスタルジアの爆発を得る可能性があります。未来のドクターウエストが不運な映画の学生の1人としてここに早い段階で登場するため、ジェフリーズのファン（「リアニメーター」）のコームズもチェックしたいと思うかもしれません。<br /> <br />私はアドバイスします読者は、印刷品質がひどいので、EastWestDVDラベル（Roy Wardの「Vault of Horror」とペアになっており、ドルの店で販売されている）にあるこのフィルムのバージョンを避けます。この映画は、Tromaの優秀な人々から豪華なリリースがあったと聞いています。あなたがTromaのような人なら、「Frightmare」はあなたの路地のすぐ上にあります。
"People watch movies for various reasons. The film wasn't on a budget, there were no special effects, no car chases, no explosions. In reality, there are not many of these in reality. At least not in my life. <br /> <br /> This is a very real movie about very real people. None of them is perfect, but you're in a situation where you learn to explore and accept other things together and make them in order. In chaos. I'm not an expert and I'm not ready to limit the possibilities of parapsychology because I don't use my entire brain. <br /> <br /> So look at the characters in this movie. It's full of cool whimsical people. <br /> <br /> In the first three minutes, Kiefer Sutherland brilliantly established detective Michael Hayden's life and continues to develop characters throughout the movie. Great acting, very reliable. <br /> <br /> Henry Czerny couldn't make a better cast and his relationship between'Harvey' and Kiefer's'Mickey' reinforces the character's opposition. <br /> <br /> Cranky Randy'Mr. Ramsey', I'm sure she and my mother-in-law are good friends!!! <br /> <br /> There are more of these cool characters, but space is limited, so watch the movies and enjoy them.","People watch movies for a variety of reasons.

"I can't imagine how these people actually work...!! Before I came to the studio to see the men working there, I actually thought the same thing as you.

There are also terrible bad actors in your eyes. It's really great and many can actually act! I don't think the material given to them can actually show it. But they are really good!

"As usual, I'm still enthusiastic to see movies I haven't seen, looking forward to Oscar. I was really looking forward to watching this movie because it seemed to be in my alley.

Tomorrow they tool in the countryside and start firing snipers. Do not wait until they return to Baghdad. There is no cohesive story. The three main characters are so caricatures that they are simple caricatures. In other words, we have a sweet child who is afraid to die. We have reinforced soldiers who want to return to a practical and safe place. And we have a reckless cowboy who doesn't follow the rules but has a soft spot for a crude little Iraqi boy who wants to sell a soldier DVD. What do you think will be ??? Well, do you think cowboy soldiers who don't follow the rules will hurt sweet kids in their betrayal way? What is it! Do you think an Iraqi child for a cowboy soldier is going to be killed and driving him crazy? What is it! There is no story here. The script is youth and predictable! The camera shakes a lot and it seems to be ""artistic"". And rent ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""Deerhunter"" or ""Platoon"" to all of you who think this is a great war picture. Don't waste your time or money in this boring movie!","As always, I'm mad dashing in anticipation of Oscars and watching movies I have never seen.

One day they are spreading a bomb. Tomorrow, they will tool around the countryside, and they will begin shooting snipers as well. They are back in Baghdad. There is no coherent story. The three protagonists are very characteristic and are just caricatures. In other words, there is a sweet child who fears death.

"A group of friends suddenly breaks out in the middle (one had a flat tire and the other a jeep doesn't start mysteriously). One of them takes the tire to the run down service station. As the remaining foursomes go out to find their friends, they meet the wonderful Slaussen who helps him fix the jeep. A very realistic mannequin, he works in a car with a group of men and leaves three women at home. Before he went, he warned them not to leave the house behind the shack. He warns them about ""Davy,"" a brother hiding and not there. Of course, one of them decided to take an adventure to find a working phone and never see it again. Is it Slawen? Are you Davy? mannequin? ? Tourist Trap has general horror requirements (big boobed girl sizzling, goody two shoes girl, curiosity improve people and never exercise!), but it's separate from the rest of the genres of the 70s. I started to feel sorry for Slaussen (Chuck Conners is great, creepy and top performance) at some point in the movie and I found Molly's personality to be almost the same, if you can find it, this is a gem;. When I was a kid, I found a copy of the VHS as I was walking through a used video store with tape wrapped with a cable, and the price was too expensive, but it was worth it. Fans of Tanya Roberts will not be disappointed either.

"Most Lorne Michaels films seem to fail because they're essentially just extended versions of skits that barely managed to make people laugh in five-minute segments. ""Tommy Boy"" is a character right from ""SNL""-a big fat lovable (in their opinion) goof who doesn't know anything.<br /><br /> David Spade gets the Thankless Overwhelmed Everyman role. He's paired with the Annoying Overweight Slob and they endure Miserable Misfortunes as they travel cross country to Save Daddy's Business.< br /><br />The plot, for starters, is really faulty.The whole premise-daddy dies and rich stupid son has to save the family biz-can be traced back to just about any movie you want.

It makes all the difference.The characters are real, the situations are far more real. ""Tommy Boy"" is pure slapstick and its ridiculous situations undermine the characters-we feel nothing for them, and we don't care about what's happening on-screen. ""PTA"" walked the careful line between outrageous and utterly believable and relate-able-""Tommy Boy"" is simply absurd, with jokes like a simple deer-in-the-headlights turning into a crash turning into a struggle with a dead deer that really isn't dead, then awakens and wrecks their car.<br /><br />The whole wrecked car thing is stolen completely from ""PTA"" and it's eerie how much stuff in this film actually does resemble the Steve Martin/John Candy movie.<br /><br />Farley is simply way too obnoxious to find likable-I've never enjoyed watching him Spade's given very little to do, serving as the movie' in any movies and this hasn't changed my mind. s most thankless character.<br /><br />Dan Aykroyd is wasted as the Evil Baddie who plans to destroy Daddy's Business.The ending is a joke, and not in a ""har-har funny"" way. More like a ""oh god are they serious?!"" way.<br /><br /> Some people dig it, that's cool.

"I was pretty disappointed when I finally saw it a year ago after reading about how great this movie has been for years, how it founded Ruiz among French critics (especially the snobbish Cahiers crowd) (however, I had high expectations) . Filmed in saturated black and white, this intentional cerebral movie (for TV, mercifully an hour long) sounds like a conversation between an art expert and an off-screen narrator while pondering a series of paintings. (Shown in Tableaux Survivor Style) Look for clues to hidden political crimes. (The terrible Kate Beckinsale movie Uncovered makes a similar claim). Borgesian is a word I've read a lot in reviews of this movie, but I would say that almost all Borges stories are more interesting than this one.","After many years of reading about how great this film was, how to establish Lewis among French critics (especially the clever Caye), I finally saw it about a year ago and was quite disappointed. Yes (but the expectations were very high). Filmed in saturated black and white, this deliberate brain film (made for television and only one hour long) is an off-screen show for art lovers, pondering through a series of paintings. It is conveyed in the form of a conversation with the narrator. (It's shown in the style of the inhabitants of Tableau) and tries to find out if they have some clues about the hidden political crime. (There is a similar discussion in the horrifying Kate Beckinsale movie ""Uncovered"").

"Many teen sex comedy movies come and go without much fanfare, but movies are often honest, fun, enjoyable, and memorable. The Last American Virgin is a special movie that has found its place, and has endured an hour of mixing four ingredients. The movie is the first time three friends (Gary, Rick and David ""The Big Apple"") are misunderstood in the world of sex and true love. In the process, they learn difficult lessons and true friendship values. We follow his hopeful romantic Gary (the main character) to win the dream girl, leading to a startling and uncertain path. If you aren't lucky enough to watch this movie yet, you'll continue to move things at a constant speed by sprinkling a lot of memorable 80s songs throughout the movie.

"I liked this show on my first broadcast, and I was looking forward to watching each episode each week. The plot, character, writing, and special effects were excellent!

"I didn't know what to exclude, so I thought it was much better not to exclude a lot. It's not a bad short film, don't commit my fault. Since Tess Nanavati is a relatively new director and writer, I think he deserves a lot of acclaim for making this film. You can say it is an act of love for her. The acting (other than Dominica) is a bit cheesy and the quality of the movie is not good, but it's actually the advantage of a low-budget movie. As the story line became more complex, there was a drag, but it didn't really interfere with understanding the film. The gag reel was fun if you loved Dominic Mohan as much as you like it. I can't ruin it, but there are certain scenes worth buying a DVD so I can keep watching. If you like the movie, check out Jagged Edge's movie The Pink Mirror. Dominic fans will enjoy this little sky.","I didn't know what to exclude, so I think it would have been better if I couldn't exclude much. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad short film.

"When I first heard about this movie, I thought it would be like Duchess (2008), but when I watched the first 30 minutes of Young Victoria I knew this was not a solid movie. Almost everything in this movie is great, the outfits are really amazing and the setting is beautifully shot. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really disappoints me is the performance. Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada) is the star of the film, and brings Victoria to life, and through this film she shows that she is a great actress, and perhaps shows her the choice of Oscar nominations for her performances. Rupert Friend is almost the same as Albert Prince, but has good chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Betani is also a Melbourne stiffman, but he is solid. Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson both play a supporting role, but I can't forget. The screenwriter may have changed too many things in the script, but I don't know. But that's how it feels about movies.

"A crew of about 20 male space explorers (literally) traveled a manned flying saucer for hundreds of millions of light years on Earth, checking in a colony founded on the'Forbidden Planet' about 25 years ago. What they found is a beautiful, socially inappropriate, beautiful, young woman more than imaginable on the planet, and a father who is a hermit philosopher who is more rumored than the devil of the ancient civilizations he immersed. <br /> <br /> This story is superficially a pulp science fiction murder mystery. Some compare it to Shakespeare's storm, but this is an insult to some sort of belief genre. The science fiction film, The Tempest, has been removed, but can you say hundreds of similar films? <br /> <br /> Below, this is a warning story about progress and technology and the social evolution needed for proper and safe use. However, the film still goes on with all the hopes for the future we expected from a show like Star Trek. <br /> <br /> Ann Francis Guy is not the only reason the film is most beautifully portrayed. Special effects, even the aesthetics of the background, can make uninspired productions and uneven acting almost inconspicuous. If you weren't looking for a retro-styled Gumi retro ornament of 1950s science fiction props, you might think you're looking at a 1960s piece. <br /> <br /> This is a special sub-genre classic. I like to call it science fiction in the 1950s, but in my opinion it's best to see if you are interested in science fiction movies and special effects. Star Trek, Lost in Space and even Farscape's 6 to 7 episodes of re-use for clever plotting are worthy of the attention of the wise fans and will continue in the future. Trekker will be particularly interested in the various aspects of the movie, which was aired 12 years later on the subject of the Star Trek original series. Race integration. I don't mean nitpick, but the lack of social progress in this film was one of the main problems I had. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this film is a glimpse of the young and handsome Leslie Nielsen, one of his first appearances. Unfortunately, Nielsen's performance is only average and sometimes extremely poor (especially the peak of the movie). Walter Pigeon is great in other movies, but he plays his role excessively. Francis, Earl Holliman, and amazing robot Robby are prominent actors in this crowd. The character actors who fill the ensemble as a whole play a great role. I think the problem with the feature film is the fault of the director and editor. Although they certainly got most of the movies very well.","A flying saucer (literally) placed by a crew of about 20 male space explorers, traveling hundreds of millions of light years from Earth, a colony founded about 25 years ago on the “Forbidden Planet” Examine. They found a robot more advanced than any other robot on earth, a beautiful, socially incompetent young woman, and a hermit philosophy plagued by more than the devil of the ancient civilizations he was absorbed in. It is her father who is a person. <br /> <br /> Superficially, this story is a mystery of the Pulp Sci-fi murder. Some compare it to Shakespeare's Tempest, but this is stretch, and in a sense, an insult to the scifi genre. Sure, what makes it a sci-fi movie is its stripped-off tempest, but can hundreds of movies say something similar to you? <br /> <br /> Below that, this is a note on progress and technology, and the evolution of society needed to use it properly and safely. Still, the film still fulfills all of our hopes for the future that Star Trek-like shows have come to expect. Special effects, and even the aesthetics of the background, are powerful enough to make non-stimulating productions and uneven performances almost unnoticeable. If you weren't in the stupid retro Art Deco style of the 1950s science fiction props, you might think you're watching a 1960s work. <br /> <br /> This is a classic of that very special sub-genre. I would like to call the 1950s sci-fi, which in my opinion is not, but a must for anyone interested in sci-fi films and special effects. Reusable in Star Trek, Lost In Space, and even in the 6th or 7th episode of the Farscape, the cleverly rendered clever plot is remarkable and lasts the attention of most sci-fi fans. I will. Trekker is particularly interested in various aspects of the film that seemed to have influenced the theme of Star Trek's original series, which aired about 12 years later, but in the 1950s (relatively mild) sexism and Racial integration, which may be disappointing in the lack of any kind. I'm not going to stumble, but the fact that the film revealed a lack of social progress was one of the big problems I had. <br /> <br /> You'll probably be watching this movie to get a glimpse of one of the first and youngest-looking Leslie Nielsen's first stars. Unfortunately, Nielsen's performance is only average, and sometimes quite bad (especially the movie climax). Walter Pigeon is very good in other films, but he also overestimates his role. Francis, Earl Holliman, and the amazing Robbie The Robot are prominent actors in this crowd, but overall, the character actors who fill the ensemble do a good job. I think the featured performance issue is, above all, the director and the editor. Although they certainly did most of the movies right."
"I just saw this film on DVD last night, and decided to check out the reviews this morning.It seems that ""I, Robot"" has polarized the critical viewing community here on IMDb (and given rise to a lot of insults and name-calling , too).<br /><br />I find this somewhat surprising, as this film is not great (or even good), but neither is it terrible (or even really bad).What this film really is, is. ..depressing.Depressing that the US film-goer population is so ready to lap up insipid, clichéd re-heats, and acclaim them as spectacular new works.This film as ""retread"" written all over it, from the plot line (an uneasy mix of Asimov and modern-day uber-action) to Smith's character (a smart-mouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium), to the special effects (that borrowed from Matrix and a few others).<br /><br / >""I, Robot"" is, sadly, quite possibly the perfect action movie for today's audience: superficial plot, insipidly snappy dialog, and lots and lots of adrenaline. Smith is mediocre, but we already knew that (he seems to be Hollywood's latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black Bruce Willis).The story has lots of holes in it, of all sizes, but I don't think most people drawn to this film are critically-minded enough to notice.Perhaps a blockbuster by today's standards, but very B-movie compared to true winners.","I saw this movie on DVD last night and decided to check the review this morning.

"I bought the whole season of Surface. I saw it in 3 days! I was obsessed with plot, theory and basically everything about this show. The actor who plays Miles is great.

"This movie must have been one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The special effect is okay, and I don't agree with other commenters. I found them pretty bad. It wasn't realistic and it was so fake that I was distracted from the real story. Archaeologists are looking for ""sets"". They don't have to say what is what or what is special. Also, while introducing a movie in ancient Egypt, it's not clear why I'm searching for a movie in California. <br /> <br /> If you are shooting a movie that takes place in the desert, please try and actually go to the desert. The beginning of the ancient ritual seems to have been filmed in the studio instead of the desert. <br /> <br /> The action level was constant throughout the film, no ups and downs, and no climax. The movie looked short and is definitely an expert in this particular movie.","This must have been one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> You have to agree with another commenter who said the special effects are okay.

"Liam Neeson depicts Scottish legend Robert Roy Macgregor since the early 18th century. He is a true actor. He's charismatic, as if he's playing all the roles. Jessica Lang is great as wife Mary. Mary is a really beautiful woman. It's her love that makes Rob Roy legendary, but her passion makes her love immortal. They need each other. Tim Roth as evil Cunningham is perfect. When you watch a movie in any way, you'll see Cunningham disgusting. The Scottish landscape is beautiful. The environment and conditions of the time were very well described. If you like history, romance, passion and love, enjoy Rob Roy. There is violence and blood, but it is inevitable to tell this story. There is no pointless violence. If you are unfamiliar with Scottish accents, you should listen carefully. One important thing that makes this movie so good is that the actor or actress is not gorgeous. They get dirty and don't actually look attractive in various scenes. It's a skill as an actor who seduces you and doesn't depend on big names, popularity or appealing sex symbols. This is special.","Liam Neeson depicts the Scottish legend Robert Roy McGregor in the early 18th century. He is a real actor. He captivates the audience with his charisma, as he does in all roles.

"When I watch this movie, I am so excited when I watch Miss World's bed scene. She has a beautiful and attractive body. When a cute girl does a bed scene and shows her completely nude body... I think men are hard to resist.... Time for cute girls like hrishita bhatt also think of nude scenes. At least I don't want to make c the nude body of an ugly woman like Seema biswas of the Bandit Queen. I match what mallicka.b said. The movie is portrayed in a way that looks kind of malicious to the original content. Emotions are not being conveyed properly. I think a few not bad performances also contributed to mediocrity. In my opinion, Tabu was a much better choice for such a role instead of Aishwarya Rai. In some of her scenes, she looks a bit gloomy, but ultimately not what the film portrayed. I also noticed some hyperactivity in some of her scenes. I'm a bitter critic of Aishwarya Rai :) I can't help it ;.. Sorry'Raincoat' was a good movie by Rituparno Ghosh I saw Choker Bali after watching the raincoat I wasn't impressed at all.","When I see this movie, I get excited when I see the bed scene of Miss World.

"They showed me twice in a very short time now in Sweden and I am so tired. Bad behavior is not enough... The story itself is too boring and has little effect.

"After watching Carlo Lizzani's documentary about Luchino Visconti, three years later, before watching this movie produced by Adam Low, expectations were high. But viewers like me were dissatisfied... I needed a critical opinion. I generally hate it because there is no documentary to satisfy all viewers. There is no documentary to fully investigate the subject. However, I was a bit confused when reading reviews already written for this title. People sometimes don't know what to criticize. So, for clarity, I'm going to divide this film into two different parts. The former was before Visconti took over and the other was Visconti. <br /> <br /> Aristocratic backgrounds, all hobbies and wealth experienced and enjoyed by young Lucino are clearly presented. After his efforts on horse racing and divorce from his parents, too much of his relationship with his mother was mentioned. We also get a very accurate idea of ​​where Lucino grew up as a real number in Milan. Rich, rich food, along with Nani, the chef who has access to everything in a true Aristocrat. For example, his father's gorgeous villa in Grazzano and another amazing villa prove it. He also focused on Visconti's important visit in Paris in the 1930s, and later he met prominent people (""left wingers"") who influenced art and his style and message. It clearly explains the idea of ​​aristocratic upbringing and communism (contrast at first sight). <br /> <br /> However, the part of his coaching career that started with OSSESSIONE during World War II and ended with INNOCENTE shortly before his death in 1976 did not work. His films were not well discussed. Why? Because few people have very little to say. Director Franco Zeffirelli remembers the work of LA TERRA TREMA. There is also an interview with Franco Rosi. But later movies like IL GATTOPARDO, LA CADUTA DEI REI, LA MORTE A VENEZIA or LUDWIG are mostly discussed by Helmut Berger. I liked the actor in the role of Ludwig, but I didn't like his interview. Also, some of the thoughts he revealed are not correct to accompany such documentaries... There is no mention of Visconti's important work like CONVERSATION PIECE, and there is no interview with the prominent cast Lancaster. You should also mention Silvana Manga No and Romy Schneider. Interview with Maria Callas is an interesting but short time. Franco Zeffirelli appreciates him as a coach, but he enjoys all of this rather than saying really valuable things. For example, he mentions how Visconti was separated from himself after years of service. Therefore I say simple and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> The important point here is a video interview with Visconti himself. As a result, we can get his opinion on his work. For example, I am very grateful to say that death is born as a normal place of life for death and that it is born naturally and naturally spoken. They also talk about health problems after a stroke while shooting LUDWIG. <br /> <br /> It is a good idea to see Carlo Lizzani's LUCHINO VISCONTI (1999) better than this document. Overall, it's short and summarized, but you can get a better idea of ​​the director: Visconti is angry about it and his anger inspires people's feelings and perspectives.","Before I saw Carlo Lizzani's documentary about Rutino Visconti and watching this film made by Adam Low three years later, I met higher expectations. But viewers like me were frustrated...I faced the need for critical opinion. I generally don't like it because there is no documentary that will satisfy all viewers. There is no documentary that thoroughly verifies the theme. But when I read the reviews already written in this title, I was a bit confused too. People sometimes don't know what to criticize.

The former is about Visconti before the director's career and the latter is about Visconti of the director. <br /> <br /> It clearly shows the aristocratic background, all hobbies, and the wealth that young Rutino has experienced and enjoyed.

Emphasis was also placed on Visconti's important visits to Paris in the 1930s, where he later met prominent people (the ""left"") who influenced his style and art message. This clearly explains (a seemingly contrasting) idea of ​​an aristocratic Communist. <br /> <br /> However, his coaching career began with OSSESSIONE during World War II and ended with INNOCENTE shortly before his death in 1976, but he hasn't done much.

There is no interview with. We also need to mention Silvana Mangano and Romy Schneider. There is one interview with Maria Callas that seems to be interesting, but only a few. Franco Zefilelli is grateful as a director, but he doesn't say anything really valuable, he makes fun of everything. For example, he mentions the events of how Visconti separated from him after many years of service. So I say: Simplified, Inadequate. <br /> <br /> I found my strength here in a video interview with Visconti himself. As a result, we may get his own opinion about his work. For example, I highly appreciate his statement that he sees death as a normal chapter of life and as natural as the birth itself. He will also talk about post-stroke health issues while shooting LUDWIG. <br /> <br /> I would rather look at LUCHINO VISCONTI (1999) by Carlo Lizzani than this document. Overall, it's short and condensed, but the director can see it better. Visconti was furious about it, and his anger usually turned people's emotions and perspectives into stone... 4/10"
"Time is precious. This movie is not. Small movies like Fargo have to learn to ignore critics who are enthusiastic about this complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> The theater was full and everyone left with the same reaction.

"Savage Island (2003) is a lame movie. Similar to home video with minimal lighting and terrible smoke. Stories and scripts are not just miserable. I don't know why this movie was made.

"Adenoid Hynkel, the lowest soldier in World War I, became the ruthless dictator of stealing mania for years to come. He makes aggressive and anti-Semitic war machines and grows small toothbrush mustaches. Does it sound like someone you know? <br /> <br /> For the sake of safety in Hollywood, Chaplin uses this soap box to encourage Europe to pick up weapons and hitch Hitler and Mussolini. Given that the United States remained neutral for more than a year in 1940 and that there was no strong desire to immerse itself in the civil struggle in Europe (it was Hitler that declared war on the United States, not in the other direction), Chaplin could spread this rude debate. I was amazed by the fact. <br /> <br /> This story includes a vulgar and apathetic Hinkel and his improper terrorist rule and life in a Jewish slum. All singles are kind, humane, and brave. Chaplin is Hinkel, and also a small hero in the ghetto, the Jewish Barber (tramp not the name). Needless to say, Chaplin composes, directs, composes stars, composes music and serves food. <br /> <br /> In 1940 the full truth was not yet known about the Third Reich, and Chaplin can be forgiven with less than a perfect historical prophecy, even by today's standards he makes Hitler wrong . Chaplin, a comedian and sentimentalist, wants to ridicule Hitler by making him a fool or friend. All of this is to humanize him. When Hinkel, a war-free soldier, stupidizes a big gun and an inverted plane, he falls in love, not despicable. As a dictator, he examines the technical innovations (parachute hats, body armor, etc.) of subordinates who are not working, and these verses make the real Nazis incompetent and set aside. In fact, Hinkel's regime was cute and liked with rugged weeds. <br /> <br /> In fact, Chaplin's Day has already passed when I made this wrong argument. In mind, he was still a quiet screen dinosaur (check the humor like a pantomime of coins on a gag and pudding like crossing the streets semi-consciously up and down). Hero Schultz is a measure of European dignity to judge Hynkel, but Schultz looks more like an operetta than a Nazi. Can Schultz's figure (if any) exist on Fuehrer's face and say, ""Your cause will end in failure because it is based on stupid ruthless persecution of innocent people""? And how will Schultz be in the basement of a Jewish ghetto? If he is the subject of a thorough man hunt, why wear a Ruritanian uniform? Chaplin is still Auschwitz -? While not fully aware of the horrors of Auschwitz-Birkenau or Treblinka, the Nazi concentration camps he offers us can frustrate desperately with the grim spirit of the time. As usual, I think Chaplin is loosely anchored in the narrative clothing line in terms of'silent' comedy set pieces. There's a way to scrape a storm pilot chasing a man with Brahms's accompaniment, and the ballet of the earth (a clock shot against the opposite). <br /> <br /> Palette Goddard is the perfect uncensored Hannah. As the slum people are incredibly good and Osterlich's Jewish refuge is ridiculously idyllic, Hannah is literally too good to be true. Brave, challenging, resourceful, hardworking and beautiful, she is a Jewish canary in Ghetto Cage. ""Hey, isn't it cute?"" She asked after the barber put on her makeup. The answer is so cute. Because Chaplin made her a caricature, she's not close to ringing. 'Are you surprised?' The speech that Chaplin put in his mouth is typical of the author. It is too talkative and emotionally closed. <br /> <br /> Jack O'Cree is as good as the bacterial fascist dictator Napaloni.

"I haven't seen the original movie in the series... I hope it was a much better movie than this sequel or sequel made in the 1980s, just like how these two horrible sequels were not justified. The film got a really good lead when they advertised to show on one of the past independent stations of the past. Anyway, it seemed to be a pretty scary movie. However, it was a movie that darkened some Walt Disney movies. In fact, this film is a light fluff with no creek creatures you can't actually see. The only real sighting will be difficult when you look at the shape when the rain is severe. The story is basically that old evil hunters kill what they see, chase creek creek creatures, and kids love to pull random boats through the water. I am not worth seeing, but I would like to see the original. The creators were able to make bad dumb creatures from the 80s, but they made very good slasher movies from the ""City of Dreadful Sunsets"" in the 70s.","I've never seen the first movie in the series...I think it's much better than a sequel made in the 1980s as if these two horrific sequels were justified I hope that.

However, some of the Walt Disney movies looked dark. Really, the movie was just a lump, and the hazy creek creatures were scarcely seen. The only real sighting comes to an end when you see its shape during a very heavy rainstorm, but other than that, there are virtually no signs of a really disappointed creature as a child. The story is basically an old evil hunter, who has to kill everything that is visible, the creatures of the swamp brook and the kids are out to help it, or the random hairy in the woods. Men prefer to pull random boats in the water. It's not really worth seeing, but I'd love to see the original. Not only did the manufacturer admit to making bad swamp creatures of the 80's, but they also made some very good and novel films in The Town the Dreaded Sundown in the 70's."
"Founded in 1928, before Walt Disney changed his name, he originally named his name Mortimer (because his wife convinced him), the Mickey Mouse became a must-have for the Disney brand. I always thought this was the first manga featuring Mickey, but in fact his third is important, but the six-minute animation short is fun. The story sees Mickey piloting the mini boat until Captain Pete gets off the bridge and stops the cargo and Minnie Mouse loses the boat. Mickey grabs the tail and plays a song as she drops her sheet music and the goat eats them, making Mickey Peel Potatoes to help other animals persecute until the pet comes back to stop him. Mickey Mouse was 53th in The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons and 31st in The 100 Greatest Cartoons.

"The Storm Country movie is probably the best of all Mary Pickford's. In two hours, the silent film of 1922 took quite a while, but it continues to attract attention for about 80 years after filming. Mary sometimes looks like a ""biggest hit"" show featuring one of her finest performances: Mary with the Innocent Role, Little Devil Mary, Little Mother Mary, Spitfire Mary, and Romantic Hostess. In the past, it was used in single films. The film surprisingly tells a candid story of an illegal child of one support character in 1922, and one day I think our young Mary is a single mother! If the Academy Awards were in 1922, no doubt the best actress Oscar of the year would be Mary's.","Tess in the Storm Country is probably the best movie of all Mary Pickford movies.

Used throughout a single movie of the past. This movie is surprisingly outspoken about one support character's illegal child in 1922, and at one point our Little Mary is considered the unmarried mother in question!

"This four-part documentary has some snippets that suggest the need for reform of recreational drug laws, but unlike many snippets of people who think drugs that are currently considered illegal are not very well developed. The only conceivable solution is to imprison even those who are guilty of having such drugs. <br /> <br /> The program as a whole leaves the impression that there is a drug war. As a rule, vain movements, waste of money, and this document deserves a little praise, so in this documentary, even the very real problems that the war with people who possess illegal drugs clearly causes and contribute, even drug warriors If you think the drug war will be resolved, I will tell you. For example, as the popularity of crack cocaine increased in the 80s, it took several minutes for the violence to soar, but the program does not imply that laws designed to curb crack cocaine make it impossible for drug sellers to enforce it. In court, I signed a contract and a business contract and continued to do business using violence. But instead of seeing the law as an important cause of violence, the drug itself seems to be responsible. Undoubtedly, alcohol bans, the resulting violence, and subsequent ban cancellations are completely ignored by this program. The main force leading to very expensive and troublesome drug wars. The possibility of including drugs other than alcohol in a happy and successful life is not really addressed. Excessive use of medication can cause personal problems, but not all users overdose, just as not all alcohol users are alcoholics. <br /> <br /> If you want someone else's point of view, he has moral rights that adults can't be imprisoned, and drugs that the government has decided for very arbitrary political reasons, not for reasons based on sound social policy and legitimate science. Use it and believe that it will ruin your life by the criminal justice system. Forget about completely banning users who figuratively decide to wage war. None of them are here. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it does not fall into the category of anti-drug propaganda. It is primarily a history of interesting neutrally presented drugs in the 20th century America, such as marijuana, LSD, heroin, cocaine, MDMA and oxycontin. However, there are important elements from the perspective of various people regarding drug law, most of which (but not all) are very thoughtful, informative, and not skewed in favor of the spirit of drug warriors, especially with regard to drugs. Other than marijuana <br /> <br /> The criminal justice system is often not the only or the most appropriate answer to all social problems, with harsh life-threatening punishment, but unfortunately there is an epidemic in this country, yet it is still in social policy for certain diseases. Lack of imagination, compassion for fellow humans, prejudice against people using drugs that are not government-approved, interest in the growth of the prison/police industry, and terrible indifference to human dignity. Absolutely kidnapping or imprisoning people is morally wrong, unless you have a good reason to do so, and having a randomly selected group of drugs is certainly not the reason. This is actually the biggest problem with drugs, but this program ignores it. <br /> <br /> In other words, part of this program is to neutralize the history of drug users without giving them stereotypes. The heart of the drug war spirit is pretty good, interesting and enjoyable. But when it comes to rational and non-radical perspectives regarding drug policy and to give viewers examples of people with drug problems, as well as many people who have successfully integrated drugs into a happy and successful life, it is very frustrating. ..","There are several snippets in this four-part documentary that suggest the need for amendments to recreational drugs, but in contrast to many snippets from people who now feel that illegal drugs are illegal. These are not well developed. A tragedy in which the only imaginable solution is the imprisonment of even those who are guilty of the mere possession of such drugs. <br /> <br /> However, this program as a whole possesses illegal drugs in this documentary because drug warfare is mostly wasteful exercise and waste of money for viewers and deserves praise. It barely touches on the very real problems that all-out war against just those people is clearly causing and contributing to. The drug warrior himself will tell you that if asked, the drug war is designed to be resolved. For example, spending minutes on the explosion of violence associated with crack cocaine's growing popularity in the 1980s, the program was designed to help drug vendors by law itself designed to suppress crack cocaine. It does not imply that it is impossible to enforce their contracts and business arrangements in court, they force them to resort to violence to continue their business. However, instead of seeing the law as an important cause of violence, the drug itself seems to blame. Mysteriously, alcohol bans, subsequent violence, and subsequent withdrawal of bans are completely ignored by the program. <br /> <br /> This program helps to persist the ridiculous stereotypes of drug users. The main force driving a very expensive and very problematic drug war. The possibility of incorporating drugs other than alcohol into a happy and successful life is not really touched upon. Excessive use of drugs can cause personal problems, but just as not all users with alcoholism are alcoholics, not all users use too much drug. It does not mean. <br /> <br /> Adults have a moral right not to be imprisoned when someone needs a perspective, and the government has a very arbitrary politics, not a reason based on sound social policy or legitimate science. For those who think that the government has decided to ruin its life by the criminal justice system just for the sake of drug reasons, figuratively forget to completely ban users who have decided not to war. .. It's not here. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is rarely in the category of anti-drug propaganda. It is an interesting, neutrally presented history of drugs in the 20th century in the United States, such as marijuana, LSD, heroin, cocaine, MDMA, and Oxycontin. But when it comes to drug law, there are important elements of different people's perspectives, most of which (but not all) are very discreet or lacking enough knowledge to support the idea of ​​drug warriors, especially when it comes to drugs. Except for marijuana. <br /> <br /> The criminal justice system, along with the penalties that often ruin a tough life, is not the only or most appropriate answer to every single social problem, but unfortunately this country An epidemic is occurring in Lack of imagination regarding social policy for certain drugs, lack of compassion for fellow humans, prejudice against people who use drugs not approved by the government, and perhaps the growth of the prison/police industry. Vested interest in and dreadful indifference about human dignity. Unless you have a very damn good reason to do so, it is morally wrong to kidnap or imprison people, and the mere possession of a group of arbitrarily chosen drugs is obviously such. That's not the reason. This is really a major issue when it comes to drugs, but this program ignores it. <br /> <br /> In other words, part of this program is a neutral presentation of history without feeding on stereotypes of drug users. The core of the idea of ​​drug war is pretty good, interesting and interesting.

Not only did he not publish a different WotW version of the story, as Wells recorded, there was no attempt to create a mood for the time using Wells, the last year of the 19th century of the 1900s. First setting in and around Woking, England. <br /> <br /> IMDb seems unkind to what they think is a ""spoiler"". It seems that the ending can actually be applied to some amazing movies, but it seems positively silly in connection with one of the most famous novels in the world. I have no sympathy for those who haven't read an important piece in English literature, so let's start tracking. The aliens are destroyed by catching the Earth's disease without immunity. If it is a spoiler, do so. After completing the book and three other movies (including the 1953 classic), you need to know how this will end. <br /> <br /> Mainly following Wells' plot, this movie is presented very cleverly. The ignorance of photos from the late 19th to early 20th centuries can attract many viewers. Although it was filmed on a wide screen, the film runs to a certain length to give a contemporary impression. The general coloring of the skin and clothes represents a sepia tint that is often found in old photographs (not black). The color is often reminiscent of the hand color. At other times, the color is washed away. Since these variations did not use standardized celluloid stocks, there were many changes in print quality from black and white to sepia/white to blue/white to red/white. You can sometimes see it here. It has a special 1920s ""real"" feel. Some effects, such as the destruction of Big Ben, are really awkward. Acting is often closer to the style of our time than ours. It may seem strange to use pomade or Brillantin for some aspects of your Victorian dress, especially your hair and facial hair. <br /> <br /> This movie only leads to Wells' original story. Viewers may find it useful to record the plot details that appear here, sometimes maintained in different versions of the story. Wells' description of Mars, a giant head mounted on numerous tentacles, is effectively portrayed. When the Mars machine appears in the movie for about an hour, it gives an impression of how Wells described the machine. Wells Y film does a great job of portraying the progress of the Martians in a limited view of the English countryside (mainly) and in several scenes in London (including Narrator's brother). The director can't show the destruction of the major landmark (Big Ben), but at least it doesn't stay excessive on the devastation of London. <br /> <br /> Mars' victory is not surprising. Despite the destruction of some machines by cannons. The narrator went on a journey to escape, and Wells sees the term ""path of mankind"" a lot. He meets a curator because of Victoria's pain of being so precious and tense. They eventually find themselves at the very edge of the Martian nest. There they find a terrible fact. Martians show their prey as living vampires in a very effective scene. Wells added that after eating, he set up a ""long-term and pleasant stay."" Narrators are obliged to unconsciously beat increasingly hysterical curators. .. Martians will resurrect as if they pull him out more We welcome Wells' story and will last for about three hours in detail It's time for the author to set his own deadline A word about acting:. Don't expect award-winning performances.... They're not bad, but the actors are passionate and grow up for you, but most film careers are often very shortened only in this film Narrator is played by hunky Anthony Piana in the second film Curator John John Kaufman-Second film as an actor, but he has more experience as a director. The brother (""Henderson"") is played with conviction by W. Bernard Bauman in his first film. Artilleryman, the only other part of the artillery of James Lars Rob in his first film, is an excellent film depicting the world's first war, first described by The World War. Despite some flaws, it is far superior to its competitors. Watch this movie to see HG Wells's'World War' (not an entirely distorted version)!",2005年には、H。G.ウェルズの素晴らしい小説「世界の戦争」が3本も撮影されました。これはおそらく最もよく知られていないもので、おそらく最も優れているものです。他のバージョンのWotWは、ウェルズが書いたように物語を非常に提示するだけでなく、それが行われるはずだった時代の雰囲気を作り出そうと試みたこともありませんでした。19世紀の最後、1900年…ウェルズを使用'イギリスのウォーキング中およびその近くの元の設定。<br /> <br /> IMDbは、彼らが「ネタバレ」と見なしているものに対して不親切なようです。それは、エンディングが実際に驚きかもしれないいくつかの映画に当てはまるかもしれませんが、世界で最も有名な小説の1つに関しては、それは明らかに愚かなようです。英文学の精力的な作品の一つを読み忘れた人々には同情はないので、追いかけていきましょう。エイリアンは地球の病気を捕まえることによって破壊されますが、それに対して免疫はありません。もしそれがネタバレなら、そうだ。本と他の3つの映画（1953年のクラシックを含む）の後で、これがどのように終わるかを知っておくべきです。<br /> <br />ウェルズの計画に続く本映画は、非常に巧妙に上映されています。 19世紀後半から20世紀初頭の写真を知らなかったため、多くの視聴者を先延ばしにするかもしれません。ワイドスクリーンの側面で撮影されていますが、この映画はある程度の時間をかけて現代的な印象を与えています。皮膚や衣服の一般的な色は、古い写真でよく見られるセピア色を示します（黒ではありません）。多くの場合、色は手彩色を連想させます。他の場合には、色は洗い流されます。これらのバリエーションは初期のフィルムに典型的なものであり、標準化されたセルロイド素材を使用しなかったため、黒/白からセピア/白、青/白、赤み/白など、印刷品質に多くの変化がありました。ここで時々見ます。特殊効果は故意にレトログレードされており、1920年代まで見られた種類ですが、火星人とその機械はウェルズが説明したとおりであり、より現実的な「感触」を持っています。ビッグベンの破壊など、いくつかの効果は本当に厄介です。演技はしばしば私たちのものよりもその時代のスタイルにあります。ビクトリア朝のドレスのいくつかの側面、特に頭と顔の毛にポマードまたはブリリアンティンを使用することは、奇妙に見える場合があります。<br /> <br />この映画は、ウェルズのオリジナルの物語に続いている唯一の作品です。 。閲覧者は、ストーリーの他のバージョンで時折保持される、ここに表示されるプロットの詳細に注意することが有益であると感じるかもしれません。火星人（多数の触手に取り付けられた巨大な頭）のウェルズの説明が効果的に描かれています。火星の機械が登場すると、映画の約1時間で、ウェルズが火星の機械をどのように説明したかがよくわかります。ウェルズもこの映画も、イギリスの田舎の限られた視点（主に）に加え、ロンドンでのいくつかのシーン（ナレーターの兄弟を含む）から火星人の進歩を描写する優れた仕事をします。監督は主要なランドマーク（ビッグベン）の破壊を示すことに抵抗することはできませんが、少なくともロンドンの荒廃に過度に留まることはありません。<br /> <br />火星人の勝利はほとんど驚きではありませんが、いくつかのマシンの大砲による破壊にもかかわらず。脱出を求めて旅行しているナレーターは、ウェルズが「人類の敗走」と呼んでいるものの多くを見ています。彼はあまりにも貴重で神経質な性格のビクトリア朝の苦しみに恵まれたキュレートに遭遇します。彼らは最終的に火星の巣の端に自分自身を見つけ、そこで、彼らは恐ろしい事実を発見します。火星人は、非常に効果的なシーンで生きた獲物を消費する吸血鬼であることが示されています。ウェルズ氏はまた、食べた後は「長くて元気なフーティング」を設定したと付け加えた。ナレーターは最終的に、ますますヒステリックなキュレートを無意味に打ち負かさなければなりません–火星人が彼を食料貯蔵室に引きずり込むのと同じように復活します（ギャラリーからの歓声。約3時間続き、ウェルズ氏の話を歓迎の詳細で説明します。そろそろ著者が納得する時期です。劇的な影響をもたらす説得力のあるプレゼンテーションです。演技について：受賞歴のあるパフォーマンスを期待しないでください。彼らは悪くはありませんが、俳優は真剣であり、あなたの上で成長します。彼らのほとんどは、しかし、しばしばこの映画でのみ、非常に省略された映画のキャリアを持っていました。ナレーターは彼の2番目の映画で気難しいアンソニーピアナによって演じられます。キュレートはジョン・カウフマンです–俳優としての彼の2番目の映画でも、監督経験が豊富です。ブラザー（「ヘンダーソン」）は、W。バーナードバウマンの最初の映画である程度の確信を持って演じられています。砲兵は、他の唯一のかなりの部分であり、ジェームズラスロップの最初の映画で演じられています。そのわずかな欠陥にもかかわらず、それはその騒々しい競合他社のどれよりもはるかに優れています。 H. G.ウェルズの世界戦争をご覧になりたい場合は、完全に歪んだバージョンではなく、この映画をご覧ください。
"Of the factors that make this the best at this point, #1 is Christine McIntire. The scene of the poisoned Shemp and her reaction is really good. As you can see from one poster, Christine tried to stop the laughter in the scene, but it actually made her look even more wicked with a smile that could possibly die. <br /> <br /> This will help you stand out. His appearance was a great cross of terrible and comical balls. Few people have chosen to meet anywhere in a dark alley or for that matter. I would have preferred a little true whodunit mystery in this. not me","Among the factors that make this the best at this point, I must say #1 is Kristin McIntyre. Her scene and her reaction when poisoned is truly spectacular. I think Christine was trying to keep the laugh out of the scene, as one poster suggests, but she actually made her look even tastier and wicked, laughing at Shemp's dying smile. <br /> <br /> Helps this stand out. His appearance was a wonderful cross between a dreadful and a comically stupid ball. Few characters would like to meet in a dark alley, or even anywhere.

"Now, this is silly. They say they are not making another nightmare movie. This is the ""last"" movie. And what do they do? Why do they play us? Anyway, this movie was meaningless at all. Very dull and the character was very dimensional. Freddie was another joker. This series was very silly. The plot is very, very bad. Worse than part 2 and part 5. I didn't get a movie. I hate this movie so much that I still remember basically everything I didn't like, the whole movie. This is so different from Freequail and I tried and tried, but this tried the hardest and it hit my face again. There was another scene of death, although they were different, they were fast.

"Everyone, my name may sound strange, but nothing else! <br /> <br /> I'm crazy because I've never seen anything like this anyway! Of course it is good. It is a humorously fun movie and my absolutely favorite thing is how to tie things together! Like chicken skewers, the fish pretend to be King Kong, and the Runt Pig refers to the ""beauty that killed the beast"", world war scenes, and more. The Walt Disney Company has not lost his touch on this. They also made it look like they were watching a movie and made it the same way as home cinema. <br /> <br /> However, some parts do not fit. Originally, like the king of lions, weren't Timon and Pumbaa with Simba when they beat the scars? Not so in this movie! They were fighting hyenas behind the scenes. The reason Pumbaa is not so sure is Timon, Timon, Timon because he was pushed by other animals. Does anyone know that pumbaa only suffered backfires, while only hearing Timonn's story?","Everyone, my name may sound weird, but nothing else! <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's crazy because I've never seen anything like this before! Of course that's a good thing. It's a humorously entertaining movie, and my absolute favorite is how they intertwin other things into one! Like Chicken Little, a fish masquerading as King Kong and a pig runt, ""was a beautiful woman who killed the beast,"" he said about the world war scene. The Walt Disney company probably hasn't lost his touch for this. Also how they made it like they were watching a movie, and it was like a home cinema. <br /> <br /> However, some parts do not fit. Didn't Timon and Pumbaa beat Skar with Sinker like the original Lion King? Not so in this movie! They were fighting the hyena behind the scenes. Moreover, Pumbaa is less confident because he has been driven away by other animals, and it is simply Timon, Timon, Timon. Does anyone know that Pumbaa had only flashbacks, while only Timon was told? <br /> <br /> But apart from that, IT ""S GREAT!"
"Finally was there released a good Modesty Blaise movie, which not only tells a story, but actually tells the ""real"" story. I admit that it is a bad movie if you expect an action thriller, but if you stop in your track and remove all your expectations. Then you will notice that it is a story that comes very close to the original made by Peter O'Donnell. You have a cover story just to tell about how Modesty became the magnificent person which she is. It is not a movie to attract new fans, but a movie to tell the real tale.Some things could have been better, but when you cannot forget the awful movie from '66 then is this a magnificent movie. So are you a fan then sit down relax and just enjoy that the real story is there with a cover story just to make Modesty tell her story.","Finally, a good Modesty Blaise movie was released that not only tells a story, but actually tells a ""real"" story.

"I haven't seen Carol Lombard in any movie, so I decided to watch this movie. To be honest, I'm sorry this is a dog. Jimmy Stewart and Charles Coburn were also great actors. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is simplicity: Too much too soon in a story about a young lawyer (John Manson, played by Stuart) who marries Jane (played by Lombard) within an hour of meeting her I'm going to put in what's that cliche. ? Hurry to marriage, repentance at leisure... <br /> <br /> In short, this story is a series of episodes showing the couple's financial deterioration, John's relationship with his biological mother, and the struggle for payment.

A lone pilot (in a violent storm) and finally John was accepted as a junior partner for a law firm to bring a special serum to save the child. <br /> <br /> Authors could face more clichés? Maybe my mother is dying soon? There were not many comedies. The drama was lacking at all. The conversation was difficult to hear. The action of the four main players was enough. <br /> <br /> This was the end of the Great Depression when the United States came out of a long recession. During this period, I experienced all the events described by many. <br /> <br /> So it was reasonable for Selznik to reaffirm America's values ​​for family, relationships, heroism, patience and initiatives against an ""average"" American background. family. Who is better than Jimmy Stewart and Carol Lombard? <br /> <br /> It should be noted that this film was released in early 1939. So it was supposed to be in 1938-shortly after the United States began production for the upcoming World War II. Therefore, this kind of film was a great help to the general public at the time, and at that time many people soon had to join the UK. As many of you know here, Hollywood and Washington have had unstable alliances before, during and after the war. <br /> <br /> But I'm glad I saw it as a piece of social and political propaganda. However, you will have to watch other Lombard movies to increase her understanding of the range of acting. <br /> <br /> As other reviewers mentioned, I saw this movie and watched all of Stewart's movies. Otherwise, don't bother.","I've never seen Carol Lombard in any movie so I decided to watch it. Frankly, this is a dog, so I have to be this one, sorry.

"Unfortunately, the only spoiler in this review is that there's nothing to spoil about the movie. Mattei never used the master piece he used to do his job, humorously and insanely, but made him a fun Eurotrash director. But over the past decade, he seemed to have lost the movie. This movie is empty. After waking up from the deep sleep after the first 10 minutes, there is nothing. Snuff?), actor, conversation, as bad as a 90' TV movie. Worse than the last cannibal and zombie epic. So Bruno, you will stay in our minds anyway, thanks forever unforgettable. Zombie 3, Robowar, Rats, l'altro inferno, virus, brutal jaw and a few others. So except this if you want to see B Mattei owned by the new movie of the spirit of jess Franco. This awesome craftsman's career tracks his old movies and knows the fun.","Unfortunately, the only spoiler in this review is that nothing spoils the movie. Even if Mattei never made the masterpiece he used to work with a little humor and madness that made him a fun Eurotrash director. But for the last decade he seemed to have lost it.

Roger Avery가이 영화의 큰 요소라고 생각하는 사람들을 위해, 우리가 그들의 논평에서 알 수 있듯이, 그가 가진 모든 것은 돈이었습니다. 본질적으로 ""마지막 사람""의 은행이었습니다. 클래식 한 Avery 순간에 대한 희망을 가지지 마십시오. <br /> <br /> Ralston으로부터 더 이상 기대하지 마십시오 – 그리고 이것이 제가 끝낼 방법입니다. <br /> <br /> Grade : ** ***** 중에서",架空の状況が豊富で、かつてのディレクターであるハリーラルストンは、通り、店、そして忘れ去られた砂漠の真ん中にない風景全体に残された、世界の死者との究極の終末論的な垣間見せてくれます。一人の孤独な生存者は、彼の正気を再燃させようとして、この砂漠の街から彼のバンガローに食物を運びます。一人で、彼はより多くのことを望みますが、周りに誰もいないので、彼は新しい下着を開き、人間の共存の障壁を打ち破るカメラの発見まで、白い下着と地元のインディアン部族への情熱を残しています。本の男アランは、未知の災害の後、地球に残されています。彼が一人だと思って、彼は自分の人生を生き始めます-ジェリー・ライアンが森から出て、乱れ、そして最後の男が生きているのを見つけるのに不幸になるまで...よく...アランのように。とにかく、彼らは共存しようとし、失敗し、酔うことを試み、究極のディストピアを作成する前に、Redneck Raphael（新人のDan Montgomery Jrが演じます）に遭遇します。絆が破れ、混乱が始まり、カップルが第三の車輪となり、身体的に無能力なオタクと頭のないジョックとの戦い。誰も惑星に残らなくても、人間の最も暗い性質が発生することは真実になります。<br /> <br />可変映画技術を使用して、ラルストンは「タイトルをつけられた別の映画に緩く基づいた平凡な物語を私たちに与えます静かに地球」（私は次に見ます）奇妙なことに彼は決して信用を与えません。借りた話で、彼はそれを再解釈するのにまともな仕事をしていると思います。ラルストンが自分のストライドを見つけようとしている間、彼のパンチは最初は欠けていたようであり、他の映画監督のテクニックを再び借りて自分のストライドを見つけようとします。彼は興味深く映画を開きますが、直接的な答えには答えません。確かに、最終日が到来しましたが、これらの選択されたいくつかが生き残った「どのように」またはより良い「なぜ」ということについての簡潔な答えがあるかもしれません。不気味な始まりは私たちをよりコミカルな映画に導いたでしょう。並置は「Shawn of the Dead」のようなものでしたが、代わりに、「テレビ用」の番組を見ているような気分になりました。音声解説を聞いて、この映画を作るために熱心に取り組んだラルストンを尊敬しています。彼の情熱はほとんど映画を売っていますが、キャストとのやり取りから、彼が全体的な決勝に満足していないことがわかります製品。間違い、彼が指摘したもの、彼が指摘するのが恥ずかしかったものなどがありました。これはまともな独立した映画制作には役立ちますが、時には安っぽく感じることもあり、ラルストンの場合は後者でした。<br /> <br /> David Arnottのアランの描写は私を夢中にさせました。彼はその弱々しい、学校のオタク、大人の役割を非常にうまく果たしました。彼は見たり聞いたりするのが面白かったので、見る人に共感しました。彼は、悲しいかな、映画をまとめる上で重要な役割を果たしました。これはダンモンゴメリーの最初の映画で、明白でした。つまり、本当に明白でした。キューカードが出てきて、セリフのセリフを読み上げようとしている場面もあり、よりリアルなパフォーマンスが得られたのかもしれませんが、残念ながらそうではありませんでした。それからジェリ・ライアンがいました。映画の最後近くで彼女は彼女の性格に引き込まれました。それは私にとって、芸術作品全体の集大成でした。彼女は最後まで、未知の疎外から苦い不気味な非常識なガールフレンドになります。混乱していますか？繰り返しますが、彼女は最後まで彼女の性格に陥り、演技が成熟したときにおそらく何ができたかを垣間見るだけでした。解説が進んでも、彼女が投稿したのは笑い、笑い、または「ああ、その色を見て」の瞬間だけでした。彼女の美しさはチケットを売るかもしれませんが、人は知識も同じように美しいと考えたいかもしれません。これは彼女の最初の映画だったので、私は厳しすぎますか？ <br /> <br />全体として、この映画は何かが欠けているように感じました。私はその考えは強力でしたが、地球上に残っているのは人間を殺すだけでも人間の本性の悪が依然として存在するという前提です。嫉妬はバクテリアや爆弾によって殺されることはできません（たぶんそれは亜鉛によって消費されるためでしょうか？）そして私たちはレースとして常に私たちが持つことができないものを望みます。ラルストンは意外な監督ではありません。彼のテクニックには欠陥があり、事前に使用されていますが、低予算のコメディを作る方法を知っています。 「面白い」という考え方は違うと思うので、彼が「ヒステリック」であることに気付いた多くのことに笑いがちになりませんでした。彼の俳優はこの映画に必要な演技のレベルを提供しましたが、それは平均よりも低かったです。彼の映画はルーズでした。つまり、完全に説明または対処されていない要素（つまり、翼が残っているものは残っていますか？！？）があり、全体的に映画の強度を損ないました。これはコメディでしたが、もっと暗くてもっとおかしいかもしれません。ロジャーエイブリーがこの映画の大きな要素であると考えている人にとって、私たちの解説からわかるように、彼がそこにいたのはお金だけでした。つまり、「ザラストマン」の銀行でした。クラシックなエイブリーの瞬間に期待を寄せてはいけません。<br /> <br />ラルストンにこれ以上期待しないでください。それが私がそれを終わらせる方法です。<br /> <br />グレード：** *****のうち

"Mercerson always felt that he had never played a role that fit his skills. Familiar to millions of people as a lieutenant in law and order, she has always been shown to play a supporting role in many theater releases. HBO's Lackawanna Blues changes this, allowing talented actresses to transform Nanny, a successful entrepreneur in the world, from separation to integration. But this is a story about the colorful characters she and her adopted son meet in the dorms of New York and Lacwanna, in the suburbs of Buffalo -... from Sweet Auburn in Atlanta to New York's Harlem American Community in the 50's and 60's But the angle of separation and integration is a subtle retention in the colorful lives of people in nanny dorms. This story centers on the relationship between Nanny and all kinds of people and is played by the best actors in the business (I'm intentional As the black actor did not tell, this ensemble is an array of amazing talents that appear in black except Jimmy Smits, of course) I recommend this movie as a fun and gorgeous look from the past.","Marcusson has always felt that he never played a role that fits his skills.

"This will not likely be voted best comedy of the year, a few too many coincidences and plot holes.However we are talking about a movie where a hit-man and a white bread salesman become buddies so a few vagaries shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. Brosnan is excellent in this role, gone is the wooden James Bond (a role he was wasted in).If he can maintain this kind of quality I hope he continues to make comedies.Greg Kinnear is also excellent as Brosnan's straight man.I' ve read a few negative comments in here about Hope Davis but I thought she was quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep within.There are lots of good chuckles as Brosnan sleazes his way through and a few scenes where I nearly died laughing.My father (a consultant) nearly lost it when Julian describes himself as a ""facilitator"". Much like ""Grosse Pointe Blank"", another hit-man comedy, the humour can be very dark.If you are in to that be prepared to enjoy yourself.","This is probably not the best comedy of the year. But since we're talking about a movie in which Hitman and White Bread salesman are companions, some whims are not so surprising. Brosnan excels in this role, and the wooden James Bond (the role he wasted) is gone. If he can maintain such quality, I would like to make a comedy. Greg Kinnear is also an excellent straight man for Brosnan. I've read some negative comments about Hope Davis, but I find she's a great housewife for mice with deep, dark sides.

"As an accidental listener for Rolling Stones, I thought this would be interesting. This is not so because this film was very'age' in the 1960s. To me (someone born in the 1980s) this seems to me the hippie martyr propaganda junk. However, I'm sure this film wasn't made for me, it was people who worked in the 60s. I expected a lot of drugs with the Stones and was disappointed. It actually showed real life and effort. I haven't seen other movie directors, but I think they're following a sort of'youth', a similar style director who gave a feel like the TV show Eurotrash. My only opinion on this is that I wasn't wasting money, it was provided free with the Sunday newspaper.","As a casual listener of the Rolling Stones, I thought this might be interesting.

"Director Don Siegel really impressed me with this film.It is starkly shot, graphic without being visually graphic, well-acted by all concerned, and covers some of the most taboo issues of any day in a workmanlike, almost expected normalcy hitherto not seen in any other film by this reviewer.I didn't know what to expect sitting down to watch this: a civil war movie or some kind of 70's soft-core peddling with Eastwood descending on a school for girls in the South. But really is is neither of those things but rather and examination, exploration, and descent into the soul of men and women-a dark commentary on what is at the core of the civilized.as one reviewer previously noted, none-none-of the characters are likable by Eastwood plays Cpl. McBurney, a Union soldier found by young Pamelyn Ferdin(you'll recognize that voice as soon as you hear it), a girl at a school for the film's end and yet each one is interesting, complex, and enigmatic. manners headed by Geraldine Page amidst the chaos that was the Civil War-particularly in the South.Soon, Page, teacher Elizabeth Hartman, lovely, young seductress Carol, and even Ferdin(Amy)have emotional/sexual ties to Eastwood-each having their own needs and secrets and problems. Eastwood is not a nice man. he plays the girls off of each other always trying to get the sexual advantage.In the unfolding we get some real interesting things revealed from latent lesbianism to incest.The Beguiled, for me, is a masterpiece that far exceeded my expectations on every creative front .This might be(except for Invasion of the Body Snatchers) Siegel's best film.It certainly is one of Eastwood's best REAL performances.page is always so very good and Hartman, Fe5rdin, et al excellent. The Gothic manse set for the school is effectively claustrophobic.Some of the sexual-laced scenes disturbing.And what happens to Eastwood is a leg up on much of the competition for creepy, eerie, demented film.","Director Don Siegel was really impressed with this movie.

It's certainly one of Eastwood's best REAL performances. The pages are always very good and Hartman, Fe5rdin and others are great. The Gothic Months set in school are effectively claustrophobic. Some of the fuck scenes are uneasy. And what's happening in Eastwood is stepping into much of the eerie and eerie dementia movie competition."

"Earthman Flash Gordon, Professor Zarkov, and the beautiful Dale Arden made the best serial so far for traveling on a rocket ship to another universe to save the Earth. In the process, gather resources to fight the evil and army of the ruthless Ming Dynasty with newly discovered friends such as Prince Barin, Prince Thun, and the wonderful Vultan, along with a flash and his friends in a spelling, epic and action-packed chapter. The jealous betrayal of Mongolia and his daughter Priness Aura (now she's a car!) This series is not cut by most of the series in terms of plot, acting, and budget, but a few miles ahead in these areas. Produced by Universal Studios, this product has a lot of previous sets in disposable sets, such as Frankenstein's lab set and The Phantom of the Opera's opera house. Overall, production value developed in 1936 to be the most modest view. The costumes worn by these strange men and women are really creative and first class. We get creatures such as Hawkman, Sharkman, Lionman, High Priest, Dragon, Octagon, Orang Upoid, Tigron (Oh My!), and many other fantastic things. Are all of them reliable and first class special effects? no way. However, during 1936, most of them were very impressive. The score is great, the chapter start is well written, and it is long and professionally graded to revive the viewer memories of the previous chapter. Frederick Stephanie does a great job of organizing everything and making a film worthy of Alex Raymond's Phenome Comic Strip. Lastly, smoke is pretty good in this series. Too often, serials don't have names without talent around one or two previous talents. Here most people are capable. Don't take me wrong. This isn't a Shakespeare group, but Bust Crabbe is as easy to work as Flash and does a good job. He featured two performers with the help of Jean Arden, Priscella Lawson and the rest of the cast. However, before reaching either of these, it's amazing to get this series at Hayes' office so that other reviewers can add it as mentioned. You can see more flesh in Flash, Jean Rogers, and Priscilla Lawson than in a decades old movie. Crabbe shorts (and unfortunately all of us, the shorts worn by Professor Zarkov ((Frank Shannon)) are about a pair of shorts for men to wear, girls are drifting in the middle and absolutely beautiful Jean Rogers may have limited behavior Talent But she is a blonde bomb Lawson is also very sexy, sensual and beautiful. But the two actors who make the chain are Ming, cold, ruthless and fun with Charles Middleton Middleton is a class act ""Tiny"" Lipson is the role of the Burning King Arrogant, funny, funny-symbolizing the pure joy of life and all the emotional essence Lipson steals every scene you are in. Gordon is the second soap opera, space opera, and countless science fiction novels Is the basis of","The best cereal ever (no discussion so far) about Earthman Flash Gordon, Professor Zarkov, and the beautiful Dale Arden who traveled to another universe on a rocket ship to save the Earth. Along the way, Flash and his friends, and newly discovered friends such as Prince Balin, Prince Toon, and the awesome King Baltan, fight the ruthless Min evil and the army in a captivating and spectacular action-packed chapter. Pool resources together for a jealous betrayal of Mongo and his daughter Princess Aura (now she's a car!) This series simply outperformed most in terms of plot, acting and budget. There is none. Miles ahead in these areas. Produced by Universal Studios, there are many previous sets that are disposable, such as the lab set from Frankenstein's bride and the Opera House from the Phantom of the Opera. In my most humble opinion, the overall production value for 1936 is up. The costumes worn by many of these weird men and women are truly creative and top notch. Get hawkmen, shark men, lion men, high priests, dragons, octasacks, olangapoids, tigrons (oh my!) and much more. Are they all believable and top notch special effects? Impossible. But most of 1936 is very impressive. The sheet music is nice, the beginnings of the chapters are well-written and well-scored long enough to rejuvenate the viewer's memory of the previous chapter. Director Frederick Stefani does a great job of stitching it all together to make a film that fits Alex Raymond's Phenom Comics strip. Finally, the acting in this series is pretty good. Often, cereals have no name and lack the talent to surround one or two previous talents. Most people here have some ability. Don't get me wrong. It's not a Shakespeare troupe, but the Buster Club does a good job in public like Flash. He is helped to stand out by Jean Arden, Priscera Lawson, and generally the two remaining performers on the cast. But before I get to these two, as another reviewer pointed out, it was surprising that this series was obtained by the Haze office. We see more flesh in Flash, Jean Rogers, and Priscella Lawson than movies decades later. The shorts worn by Crabbe (and unfortunately for all of us, Professor Zarkov ((Frank Shannon)) fit perfectly with the two shorts men can wear. Girls overall are medium Wearing a drift of and absolutely beautiful Jean Rogers may have limited acting talent, but she is a blonde bomb, Lawson is also very sultry, sensual and beautiful. For, the two actors who make the cereal are Charles Middleton, who is lucid, ironic, ruthless, and fun. Middleton is a class act. Jack ""Little"" Lipson plays King Bartan: Rough, Excited Yes, hilarious-a symbol of all the essence of life's pure joy and hedonism. Lipson steals every scene he is in. Conspiracy meanders here, there, and everywhere-but Flash Gordon It is the penultimate space opera and the basis of the science fiction that continues."

I highly recommend this documentary.I am watching it now on TV, 5 years later, and I am still crying over the tragedies.The fact that this contains one of the only video shots of the first plane hitting the tower is amazing.It was an accident, and look where it got them.These two brothers make me want to have been there to help.","The events of 9/11 didn't hit me until I saw this documentary.

"Perfect movies are rare and even my favorite movies tend to be flawed -. The rear window sometimes looks a bit dark, the character of Chris Elliot of Groundhog Day doesn't work, and the music score of our best years of life is so bad. The beginning of Cabiria's night is a bit slow, but this movie runs perfectly from start to finish . <br /> <br /> The script is great and the acting is great in every way (Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterstone are great and the whole cast shines), but the directors and photos are inspired and like some overly manipulated Miramax scores It will interfere. Every sad moment truly moves, every light moment makes me laugh. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen and I hope there are more. <br /> <br /> I'm glad Reese Witherspoon has been in stardom since this movie, but I'm sorry that the recent movie is much more escaped and stupid than a serious movie about real people. Real emotions and real problems. excellent! Highly recommended.","Perfect movies are rare.

"This should be one of the 5 worst movies. This plot seemed to appeal to passenger 57. But in the latter film it worked much better anyway. The plot was solved in the worst way. In just a few minutes of the horrible moments in the movie, are the crew standing in the open doorway of flight 747 and trying to close the door without falling into the wind at 250 miles per hour?!? After that, the aircraft lands a few miles away, starting at 8000 feet, making it impossible for even 747 pilots with thousands of hours of experience. When on the runway (completely straight), she is instructed to pull the flap. There is a flap to use the thrust reverse to the engine on the runway and to secure the lift at low speed when giving maximum power! I can go on about most of the big mistakes in movies, but the answer will be the size of the English dictionary. This is the movie you want to miss.","This has to be one of the five worst movies ever created. The plot looked interesting, like the Passenger 57 plot.

"Other people's words, b movies and effects are not performed properly. If you are a vampire fanatic, I think it would be okay if it weren't 10 to 10. We should not read this as a book, but as a movie, so not only the story, but the effects and characters are also important. The story is good, but it does not convey the movie. I chose to watch this movie when I saw a good review on IMDb, but I write this because I was very disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I think the Blade movie is awesome and I liked the underworld movie, but this character is not close. The vampire's makeup is not properly made and the effect is worsened. This sucks. If you haven't read the reviews here, you may not be too disappointed. Reviewers must be related to the production company or something. Seriously, if you think this is great, you are not interested in behavior or composition. This is better as a book. 3 out of 10 for a decent story..","No matter what someone says, it's a b-movie and the effects aren't well done.

"I would like to believe that the above quote (especially the English subtitle translation) that was not actually written as a rejection letter to the protagonist by the publisher is self-referencing with the tongue. Way of cheek. But then, director Leo Karax ignored ignoring the actors of the true nature of the film. They are very frightened to describe that Carax actually took it here seriously or concluded that it had too much contempt for others, especially viewers. br /> <br /> Some people can't make oblique and bizarre movies using rare and unique personal styles (eg David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky) while others use subtle approaches to create surreal elements of the story. Weave on the fabric (eg. Krzysztof .. Kieslowski and David Cronenberg's later, less bizarre work) In Pola X, Carax throws separate chaos at viewers and dares him to find flaws in him Well, here it is: gap It is irregular and uneven, especially continuity. Frequently omitted are a lot of unnecessary characters (eg gypsy mother and child).. Most performances are done excessively. Lighting is often not good in sex scenes that are often discussed. Why unconnected scenes stand out. Without being sprayed in the movie. <br /> <br /> It's not entirely negative, but it should be noted that there are some exceptions. I liked the musical sheet music, and even the discordant industrial techno music played in a complex industrial complex where the protagonist retreated in the second half of the film industry. Most of the countryside photography was an obvious attempt to contrast with the beautiful, harsh urban environment. And even in the middle ages, Cathering Deneuve still shows that he still has it. Her performance was also the only one among the main characters who did not fall into the bath. <br /> <br /> It was faster to think of these films as more charitable with ""Pola X"". Even if the experiment doesn't work, the experiment is great. But Carax doesn't try anything new here. This film is a pastry of elements borrowed from numerous early films, and after decades of movie watching and literally thousands of films, it no longer has the patience of this kind of original and poorly crafted travel. In the early 21st century, one Pierre-Jeunet","The above quote (specifically English subtitle translation) was not actually written, it was written in the rejection notice sent by the publisher to the main character, not the speaker, and verbal self-reference I want to believe it was something to do-Chikmananer. But if so, Leo Calax seems to have neglected to tell the actors the essence of the film. We have to conclude that Carax is really seriously working here, as all their depictions are terribly serious. If not, you can't bother to put someone in a joke, because everyone is downplaying the audience in particular. <br /> <br /> Due to Elan's unique personal style (such as David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky), some youths don't like making diagonal weird movies. Others use a more delicate approach, weaving more realistic elements into the story's components (eg, Krzysztof Kieslowski, and the latter half of David Cronenberg's less bizarre work). At Pola X, Carax threw a mess of viewers at the viewer and dared to spot a failure. Well, it's here: Pacing is unstable and choppy. In particular, continuity is often omitted. There are lots of extra characters (eg gypsy mother and child); most performances are overworked. Lighting is not good, especially in the often discussed sex scene. Unconnected scenes are pushed into the film for no discernible reason. And the list goes on. <br /> <br /> Note that there were some uplifting exceptions, although not entirely negative. I liked the sheet music, and even the unpleasant industrial techno music playing in an abandoned abandoned complex where the main character retreats in the second half of the movie (probably a reference to Andy Warhol's ""factory"" in the 1960s). Is not it?) . Many of the countryside photos were beautiful and a clear attempt in contrast to the dirty urban setting. And even in middle age, Cathering Deneuve shows that she still has it. Her performance was the only one of the main characters that did not immerse her bust. <br /> <br /> It was in the old days that I considered such films more charitable as ""Paula X."" Even if the experiment doesn't work, the experiment is fine. But Calax doesn't try anything new here. This film is a pastry of elements borrowed from countless early films, and after decades of movie watching and literally thousands of films, I simply created this kind of non-original and clever creation. You're losing patience for untryp. At this early stage of the 21st century, you are asked: Except Jean-Pierre Jounet, is there a director in France who knows how to make a movie that can be watched? Rating: 3/10."
"It is difficult to praise this movie. Dragon's CGI performed well, but lacked adequate modeling for light and shadows. Also, the same scene is used endlessly by stepping on a slightly boring hallway. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see ""Marcus Aurelius"" in acting credits, wondering what the Roman emperor was. The Empire was playing in this movie! It should be a nickname like ""Whoopie Goldberg"" and anyone featured on this sticker can blame him for using the nickname. .Must watch this movie","It's hard to admire this movie.

"When I watched a movie with my parents in the summer of '78, I remember when I watched it. Of course, I was 7 years old at the time. <br /> <br /> Just before the Jackson movie, my wife and I borrowed this movie because we had never seen it. I felt perfume. <br /> <br /> Ralph Bakshi's animation process in this film ran out of money in the middle and drastically cut the corner of this piece. The film is telling something because it's mainly produced by rotoscoping, an animation technique for budgeted people. Most of these films are only animated in the loosest sense of the word. There are a few scenes with people standing in front of the screen, with animation effects superimposed on them. <br /> <br /> Due to budget constraints, the movie has already become even more violent with some of the ""Round Expedition"" and ""Two Towers"".

It's good to imagine what it would look like with good funding. <br /> <br /> This film is notable for having a sequel that never came.

"Just finished watching 2FTM.The trailers intrigued me so much I actually went to see it on opening weekend, something I never do. Needless to say I was very disappointed.The story has so much potential and it's frustrating to see it get screwed up. I really feel the problem with the movie was the directing and Matthew McConaughey. First off I am not a MM hater, I thought he was awesome in both Reign of Fire and Lone Star.I enjoyed his performance in those movies without having to see him with his shirt off 3-4 times.Yes we all get it that he a good-looking guy with a nice body, but I think most people knew this 10 years ago when he came on the scene in A Time to Kill. Showing him with his shirt off pumping iron like a sweaty madman 3-4 times in the movie is totally unnecessary.I think one time would have been sufficient.It wouldn't surprise me if they threw those unnecessary scenes in so girlfriends and wives would be willing to tag along with their significant other, no woman wa nts to see a movie about sports gambling, unless......Enough about that, let's get into his role.I feel his acting was very forced and he didn' t seem very comfortable.I know his character was supposed to be This was almost like he was referencing Days and Confused lines a few times! In short, I didn't like his character even though I was supposed to. The accent, his shirt off, corny pick up lines, weak sales pitches. His character was just too much of a tool, as Brandon or Jonathan. Pacino and Assante were great, but that' no surprise. Piven is fun to watch as Arie....oooops I mean Jerry. I just feel this movie was very commercial and put together poorly.It's insulting that they could take a great story, and throw in crap ingredients to try and make it a box office success. 1.Cool story that appeals to the male man 2.Hunky Hollywood actor for female women (make sure he has numerous scenes with shirt off lifting weights) 3.Al Pacino with 4 great speech scenes, and 25 great one liners 3. Every character shall be dressed in thousand dollars suites and have an extremely dark tan 4. Jeremy Piven to play the same character he did in Entourage and Old School 4. Throw in Armand Assante to seal the deal 5. Plot, good writing, character development, and intelligent casting are unnecessary<br /><br />This will be good enough for most people, but not me! Anybody who disagrees with me, ask your self this. Would this movie be much better if: A. Directed by Sodeberg B. DeCaprio or Ed Norton as Brandon instead of MM<br /><br />I will probably be part of the minority in thinking this movie sucks .I realized this when the woman next to me started crying during the ridiculous ending scene of Pacino shedding a fake tear while embracing Russo.The financial success of this movie will ensure one thing.The movie going public gets what the movie going public wants, big budget crapola.","I have finished watching 2FTM.

"I heard about driving classes through ITV commercials and, to be honest, I didn't know how much I liked it. I turned on the TV last night and was completely surprised. Driving lessons are humble and simple movies that draw you right from the start. Rupert Grint does a great job of socially awkward teenage Ben. He is definitely someone to pay attention to in the future. Dame Eve Walton is played by the wonderful Julie Walters. I liked the simple plot and the way actors portray their characters very sensitively. The highlight of the movie was Evie's rather fancy poem for me. It shows how to form friendships between the least likely pair. In my opinion, taking a driving class is a great way to spend 2 hours, the scenery, especially the countryside, was impressive. Who can forget this shiny comedy?","I just heard about driving lessons through an ITV ad, and honestly, I didn't know how much I wanted. I was surprised to turn on the TV last night.

"For Greta Garbo's first story, MGM wisely chose Eugene O'Neill's Pultizer Prize, who won the play ANNA Christie in 1921. <br /> <br /> Wisely, the producers backed up Garbo with the original Broadway cast (Griorge Marion, Anna's father, Chris, James T. Mack, Johnny Johnny of Priest). <br /> <br /> This little change is interesting. The movie wants a movie and wants to ignore its origins. Just as there are so many movies that people are criticizing, the problem is not a play, but a filmmaker who is more loyal to his property: too many people first because he dilutes a good cinematic stage work and doesn't piss off or heat up others. Losing qualities worth filming from <br /> <br /> Luckily, the studio's respect for O'Neill and Garbo was a wonderfully destructive process by ANNA Christie in Frances Marion's generally sensitive screen adaptation. Surprising is marvelous, and Marion allows Garbo's Anna to point to a scene that reveals her past to a man who wants to marry her and the past badly in ""The Farm"" and the father who sent her wit. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with source play is that Chris' friend Marthy always tends to take the first action and disappears from the last two so Anna can take the stage. A truly good girl's double-sided guy doesn't always recognize it.<br /> <br /> Fully cast Marie Dressler (cut off her teeth before going to Hollywood on the Broadway stage) is 90 with Gar bo Anna in the area. It's the perfect balance of three fast-moving movies, a few minutes, don't waste too much time missing her, not convincingly portrayed in the original, but one of the few advantages that the atmosphere offers. Marion is oh Smart enough to get out of Neil and touch the derailleur again. Two-thirds of the movie reminds me of Julie Laverne's second act in SHOW BOAT. <br /> <br /> The initial scenes of Anna and Marthy together on the screen (16 minutes in the movie) taking action from each other and setting the tension of the rest of the story are among the most influential scenes in the entire work. Do not miss. <br /> <br /> ANNA Christie is a great tragedy and movie drama. The remake of the second half will almost completely lose the grit and mood of the remake of 1930. It was hard to imagine that it was possible to improve this excellent shoot (which was first filmed silently in 1923-also with George Marion's original Broadway Chris). <br /> <br /> The inside scene looks the closest to the play, but those who feel the atmosphere should not miss the outside. Wallpaper work does not conform to modern technology standards, but the background looks better than most movies in the real world (especially New York Harbor) era where screen playback is set. <br /> <br Almost all of Garbo's naturalist performances of the sound age remained almost as good. Her 1932 film, MATA HARI and GRAND HOTEL, and the magnificent Lubitsch, along with her 1939 comedy film NINOTCHKA (""Garbo Laugh!""), were selected for her best work. <br /> <br /> O 'You must find 2 VOYAGE HOME (1940) in ""The Sea Play"". Depicted as skillfully as sea play by ANNA Christie, one of the rare non-Westerns, John John Wayne, shows him a great way to veteran actors.","As a picture of Greta Garbo's first story, MGM wisely chose the 1921 theater ANNA Christie's award-winning Eugene O'Neal's Partizer Award. <br /> <br /> Also, the producer backed Garbo with two members (Anna's father, George Marion, Chris, and priest, Jenny T. Mack), instead of one of the original Broadway cast. did. Harp for the movie so as not to get offended""). <br /> <br /> This small change is interesting. As with many films accused of ""making MOVIES a MOVIES and ignoring its origin"", the problem is not the film, but the film's producer, not the property. .. By diluting the stage work of a great movie so that nobody cares, or opening it as they can, too many people lost so much quality that it was worth filming in the first place. .. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, because the studio respected both O'Neill and Garbo, Anna Christie was a supermodel of Francis Marion's commonly-sensitive screen mod, which successfully withstands the usually destructive process. I was able to. A wonder of wonder, Marion even allows the point of the scene where Anna Garvo reveals her past on the ""farm"" to the man she wants to marry badly and the father who sent her straight there! The alliance of good sense must have been thinking about it! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with source play is that Anna can stand on stage because Chris' friend Marcy always tends to leave in the first acting and disappear from the last two. -Two aspects of really good women Men do not always recognize. <br /> <br /> The perfectly cast Marie Dressler (who cut her teeth on the Broadway stage before going to Hollywood) was also perfect for Galvo Anna and just 90 fast-moving movies in the area. It is a good balance. Minutes, we don't allow too much time to miss her-one of the few advantages that the atmosphere shows rather than eloquently described in the original-and screenwriter Marion is touched It's smart enough to leave O'Neill to bring dresser back for, reminding many of Julie Laverne's second appearance at SHOW BOAT with a two-third scene in the movie. <br /> <br /> Showing the early scenes of Anna and Marthy together on the screen (16 minutes on film), taking measurements of each other and setting the tension for the rest of the story is the whole piece. Is one of the most influential scenes in. Do not miss it. <br /> <br /> ANNA Christie is a great tragedy and a great movie drama. A later remake that will almost certainly lose the grit and mood of this 1930 remake (first filmed without sound in 1923-along with George Marion's original Broadway Chris) could improve this excellent shoot. Is hard to imagine. <br /> <br /> The interior scenes are the closest to the play, but the look is something anyone who cares about the atmosphere can't miss. The work of the background screen is not in line with modern technology standards, but the background looks better than most films in the real world era (especially New York Harbor) where screenplay is set. <br /> <br /> Almost all Garbo's naturalistic performances in the sound era are superbly supported (only the parodyed death scene from CAMILLE seven years later is a strong direction). And occasionally draws a snicker for the parody), but this ANNA Christie shows Lubitsch the noble to the various films of 1932, MATA HARI and GRAND HOTEL, and the comedy NINOTCHKA of 1939 (""Garbo laughs!""). Along with the touch, her masterpiece is undoubtedly. <br /> <br /> O'Neil Fan, taken to this play at the end of his acclaimed ""Theatre of the Seas"", was a wonderful second released in the year before the United States entered into conflict. The World War II shaped movie THE LONG VOYAGE HOME (1940) needs to be tracked. This, like the ANNA Christie, was artfully portrayed from these maritime plays, where one of the rare non-Westerns featured youthful John Wayne, supporting the cast of veteran actors. I will."

"As a long-time fan of all Star Trek series, I found this a frustrating episode, actively using ""flashback"" featuring Will Riker's exploits, positively (and greatly romantically) and negatively (a lot of pain, (Hospital's death) was a money-saving device like many ""hospital shows"" (the episode where all the scenes take place in the enterprise) Diana Muldaur (who appeared at least twice in the original series) told her character, Dr. Kate Pulaski We deserved a better final look than this, and we also lacked loyal viewers (is there any other kind of Star Trek world?) This was the last episode of the second season, so the season wasn't ""struck"" but ""whi sound"" It is over.","As a longtime fan of all Star Trek series, I thought this was a disappointing episode. The liberal use of ""flashback"" featuring Will-Liker's exploits is positive (and mostly romantic) and negative (a lot of pain and death of the crew) in their many ""bottle shows"" ( It was a money-saving device, as in all episodes of the Enterprise). Diana Malder, who also appeared more than once in the original series, deserved a better final look for her character, Dr. Kate Plasky. The loyal audience (is there anything else in the Star Trek world?) has also changed. This was the last episode of the second season. In this way, the season ends with ""not a bang"" and ""wimper""."

He's the one who finances Tom Sharky, the deputy detective on the trail of the Vittorio Gassman, and the next governor of Georgia (Earl Holliman). In the novel by William Diehl, the story is more complicated because the man runs toward the president. This is a very long movie that feels like 3 hours instead of 2 hours. Shooting at downtown Atlanta and the Peachtree Plaza Hotel creates an atmosphere that's right for the story. Reynolds does not laugh much about this compared to his comedy film. He is very serious, especially at the beginning of the movie. Because he is demoted to the wrong drug bust. Sometimes, however, the movie is played more like a voyeuristic drama than a crime movie where Burt tries to get closer to a mob woman.

"First of all, the movie's CGI was terrible. I saw it during a bad movie marathon on the SciFi channel. Eventually, when the owner of the park was killed, it's probably one of the worst examples of CGI I've ever seen. Even the night of the living dead had better animations. <br /> <br /> There was little conspiracy in the movie. Why were they on the island? Well, it wasn't mentioned in the movie. And why do people keep coming into the realm of cats? That's ridiculous. <br /> <br /> One thing that stands out in this movie was the moderately good acting. What I could say as a “B for TV Movies” movie was very good acting. Parry Shen was particularly noticeable. <br /> <br /> If you have nothing to do on Saturday, watch this movie.

March! I hate her She's not part of the Northanger story, nor is she a boy on the Cartwheel page. <br /> <br /> Some of the scripts are strange. When Catherine asks Eleanor Tillney about her mother's death, she asks, ""Do you think you saw the body? How did it appear?"" What a ridiculous thing! The mild reaction of Eleanor is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Tell me if you agree or disagree anyway"

"A nice little movie about introducing movies to China. As depicted worldwide, it surprises the first audience of the movie and uses real Lumiere movies in most real scenes. I do not agree with others about the bad behavior of the British side. I thought he was great, but the Chinese leader actually stole the show. Anyway, I found me with a smile on my face through most of the movies. Those who are afraid of subtitles will find that many movies are in English (for some reason, not only Chinese on DVD, but also subtitles).","A nice little movie about introducing a movie to China.

"sigh. It's embarrassing to know that these short shows get attention and challenges. I saw this film at the festival before filmmakers got the attention and immediately forgot it. It was a bit annoying to watch the Christmas splendor, narration, set design I've seen many times, weak team button style, and swiping stories that are nowhere else. And we got the ""joke"" about shooting a crow for 45 for the first time. <br /> <br /> But what I really can't tolerate is to take a peek at the basic concept in a comic book called LENORE around 1999. Roman Dirge, the cute little death girl! Fast internet search is released. I mean, what is this? Is this based on Hollywood contracts and opens the door for filmmakers in Canada? Like Don Cherry says.","Ah. It's confusing to see such shorts get attention and challenges. I immediately forgot to see this film at the film festival before the film director caught the attention. Watching Grinch Who stole the Christmas heart gag with narration, the set design that was seen many times before, the overall weak Tim Burton-like style, and a story that goes everywhere. It was a little unpleasant. And I heard a ""joke"" about shooting a crow for the first time at 45, okay? <br /> <br /> But what I really don't accept is that it even steals the basic concepts from a manga around the year 1999 called LENORE, Roman Dirge's THE CUTE LITTLE DEAD GIRL. !

"Cute idea... salesgirl Linda Smith (Yolande Donlan) inherits a small little county Lampidorra. The country, which was not even in North America, became the 49th week. (There have been 48 states since 1952.) Linda travels to her country. She follows her, trying to figure out what to do with this wonderland and even quirky people. At some point, she sings a song claiming to be Navajo from her own. And it gets thinner and thinner there. Other songs are scattered as citizens sing to greet the new princess. Dark Bogarde, a cheese company in the UK called Tony Craig, was filmed in the UK's famous technicolor or equivalent film. Bogarde gained great popularity in the British film industry after working in the war, and QE II wrote the article. Craig and the ""New Princess"" are clashing with each other, and the adventures are more entangled as Lampidora's financial problems get worse. In addition, Donlan later married the author and director of our small project, Val Guest, and has been married for 50 years! Guest is well known for writing and directing science fiction films in the United Kingdom and the United States.","A cute idea...

". A small film called MAKING LOVE in 1982 shocked the audience by honestly and openly portraying a romantic love story for two people. LATTER DAYS is more than that.<br /> <br /> Yes, soapy water, melodrama, cliche, and very rough feeling. That is so great. There is no such thing as a good romantic movie, and this one is romantic in the sense of words. <br /> <br /> Regarding the issue of religion, I'm sorry people, but this is happening to gay people. It is not only the Mormon Church that rejects homosexuals. Homosexuals of all religions face harsh judgment and rejection. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. The fantasy romance based on the character's daily life is in perfect harmony. A good love story never goes out of style if you can give it more than 10 stars.

"This time the concept of Laurel & Hardy acting as a chimney sweep was surprisingly fun. It, of course, guarantees Stan Laurel's fun situation and stupid pranks as usual. <br /> <br /> The film also has a subplot with a nutritious professor who studies rejuvenation formulas. It doesn't sound like a logical mix of storylines and inconsistencies, but the two plot lines perfectly blend into a memorable ending. It's a bit strange though, but it works great in movies because it's fun. <br /> <br /> The movie's cheer cast is amazing. Sam Adams is a classic butler, and Lucien Littlefield is a nutritious professor who is deliciously topped. Nevertheless, watching them became fun thanks to the way they were all executed. It helps to make ""Dirty Work"" a better Laurel & Hardy shorts. <br /> <br /> 8/10","This time, the concept of Laurel & Hardy acting as a chimney sweep is surprisingly hilarious.

"This movie came with great disappointment. The anime series ended with a relatively stupid contortion and pretty lame hurried introduction of the villain, but I expected Shamballa to tie all the loose ends. Unfortunately it was not. It adds more plot holes than solved and is more confusing than clear ones. Animation and voice acting were great, but stupid plots, dull settings (most movies don't open in the dull WWII district, not alchemy world) and disappointing endings (Ed is useless for the rest of him) A few days in a world without alchemy While he stabbed Winry?), it was quite lacking. Ignore the last half of the animation as well as this movie and read the manga.","This movie was very disappointing.

"Maybe I liked this movie partly. It's a lovely little fairy tale because I didn't feel good at the dump. Whatever the reason, I thought it was the perfect pitch. Great and intelligent stories, beautiful effects, great acting (especially De Niro, awesome people). This movie is happier than it has been for a while. <br /> <br /> It is a very fun and clever movie. Jokes about the history of the savage and aftermath of the prince of the kingdom, the way witches and dozens of smart little hands fall into the magical effect, fascinated me. That's a lot of what makes it so good. It's a sophisticated, special-effects film with more stories than most fairy-tale films, but it's got a lot of attention for little things.","Maybe I liked this movie so much.

"I was amazed that ""Franklin Forgiveness"" didn't get more of a topic at the Sundance Film Festival this year. In some cases, the laughter of the screening I saw was so large that I could hardly hear the movie. The film has a great acting and a story that actually makes you review a wide range of issues. You know little problems like religion, sex and truth. Many comedy films seem to rely on the situation of old cornice. Many people think, ""I know I have torn this out in some sitcoms."" Jay Floyd is a fantastic glimpse into the movie because of the tight budget","I was surprised that ""forgiving Franklin"" wouldn't be a topic at this year's Sundance Film Festival.

"You need to issue this conspiracy overview to all aspiring filmmakers arriving at the Hollywood bus stop. Then fill in the blanks and set up a story in the village or city slum that just arrived. The film knows exactly about four young boys playing with an opening shot, a narration voice played in rough slow motion. After the bus stop, the next stop needs to buy stock footage of four young boys playing in rough slow motion. If they grow up, you can easily find the writer/director out of 4 people. He is a quiet, meditative, long-haired man who has never seen a book in his pants. This means that his great writing talent will be his ticket from Hickville to Hollywood. Write here or talent. It doesn't show and if you still don't know who you are, there are hints:. The middle name for auteur and his character is the same, it took an hour to think that these 20 men should still be in high school. It looked like high school, and the director turned out to be the principal. One more poor and misunderstood poor rebel can push everyone in the movie into pavement, murder, and looting, but has no power to fight his alcoholic father. How about counterattacking like everyone else? Numerous fist-fighting scenes with no apparent purpose. Very bad conversation. Out of focus in many scenes. The cartoon characters continue to appear as beat players and extras, drawing unintended laughter from the premier audience. Extremely overkill. And if you don't get an important speech or slow motion scene for yourself, listen to overwhelming music. It is a clue to you and what you are supposed to feel. Poor Marisa Ryan has to accumulate a lot of frequent mileage while traveling to the country where she works in this amateur local movie. The biggest sin is that the audience is sympathetic to children who are shot at an old lady, jump over a dog tied to a tree, grieve at children who steal and steal, and complain about sorry lives. But if we can get out of this rustic village and go to college. Yes, that's the ticket Why do filmmakers in their 20s believe that the world has so far been so important and interesting that the world cannot wait to see the screen? If this movie looks like an autobiography, the writer is encouraged to look over the shoulder for a police officer with a fugitive warrant.","They need to publish an overview of this plot to all aspiring filmmakers arriving at the Hollywood bus stop. Then fill in the blanks and set the story in the just arrived Hicktown or Urban Ghetto. From the opening shot, four boys playing in grainy slow motion with a voice of narration know exactly what this movie is like. The next stop on the bus stop is to buy stock footage of four boys playing in grainy slow motion. Once you've grown up, it's easy to find a writer/director among the four. He is a quiet, meditative long-haired man, unheard of without a composition book in his pants. This means his excellent writing talent will be his ticket from Hickville to Hollywood. There is nothing here to direct your writing or talent. If you still don't know who he is, here are some tips: Auteur and his character have the same middle name. It took me over an hour to realize that these guys in their twenties were still supposed to be in high school. It was apparently in high school that it looked like a prison, so the observer turned out to be the principal. Once again, the poor, misunderstood rebels can stab everyone in the movie to sidewalks, murder, and looting, but they have no power to confront his alcoholic father. How about fighting back a child, like everyone else? Many fist battle scenes without a clear purpose. Bad howling conversation. Many scenes are terribly out of focus. Cartoon characters continue to pop up as bit players and extras, unintentionally laughing at the premier audience. Extremely overactive. And if you don't get any significant speech or slow motion scenes, listen to overwhelming music. It will be a clue to you and what you are supposed to feel. Poor Marisa Ryan must have run flyers frequently because she has traveled all over the country working in these amateur films. The biggest offense is that the spectator is supposed to shoot an old lady with a gun, run up to a tree-tied puppy, and feel sympathy for children robbing and stealing. But if you can get out of this quiet city and go to college. Yeah, it's a ticket. Why do all the filmmakers in their 20s believe that his life so far is so important, entertaining, and can't wait to see the world on screen? If the film seems to be autobiographical, the young man is better to look over his shoulder at a police officer with a warrant who has escaped."
"I watched this movie so you don't need it! I have great respect for Chris Christofferson, but what was he thinking? Did he do this for scale? <br /> <br /> At least the title of the movie is the truth in advertising. This is because people and objects are routinely disappearing from the whole movie and confused. Kristofferson mentioned this in his commentary, but wasn't sure if the character of Genevieve Bujold actually existed. It's not good that viewers can follow the story! <br /> <br /> The ""Create"" function was much more fun than the movie itself.

"I went to see this movie at the Mar del Plata festival (Argentina). After the first half of Cutting Moments, I had to blindfold and occasionally peek once.

WAAAAY was too violent and disgusting! In fact, I was impressed by many brave people who loved it. I haven't got a way for you to love that kind of movie! The shocking and bloody horrible images I've seen really stuck to my head for two days! I also try to analyze the story (my boyfriend saw everything and talked about it).

"Stephen What you did has reached a whole new lows. Strange since Steven's last film Shadow Man was directed by the same director who dumped this crap. Shadow Man was too bad because this was tartly bad. It wasn't funny. Stephen rarely appeared in the movie and felt like a cameo. As for the action, let's say oz's wizard has more actions than this crap. There is almost no action in the movie, and when you finally arrive, you get bored of a badly depressed scene called an action scene. Unlike his overfilm, Sigal occupies a single army, rarely killing anyone who is under siege and hurts. The plot is confused with too many plots, sometimes not creating a scene. Furious better then shame what I wasted 5 pounds on this crap then shame 10 then better luck","Stephen, what did you do? It's weird because the shadow guy in Stephen's last movie was directed by the same director who did this rubbish. Shadowman was good and it wasn't even weird because it was devilishly bad.

"A call-girl witnesses a murder and becomes the killer's next target.Director Brian De Palma is really on a pretentious roll here: his camera swoops around corners in a museum (after lingering a long time over a painting of an ape), divvies up into split screen for arty purposes, practically gives away his plot with a sequence (again in split screen) where two characters are both watching a TV program about transsexuals, and stages his (first) finale during a thunderous rainstorm. ""Dressed To Kill"" is exhausting, primarily because it asks us to swallow so much and gives back nothing substantial.Much of the acting (with the exception of young Keith Gordon) is mediocre and the (second) finale is a rip-off of De Palma's own ""Carrie ""--not to mention ""Psycho"".

In the final showdown, Korczak tried to short the ""Beast of Power"" in the explosion of sparks and swirling flames. Yeah, I had to be there then, but it was an interesting idea. <br /> <br /> McGabbin has always packed his role with a lot of energy and enthusiasm, which was one of his best. <br /> <br /> Definitely a TV ""hall of fame"" place. Tony Vincenzo quotes... ""Kolchack you are ON IT""... or, in the case of the Hall of Fame, ""IN it""!"
"I think it's all in my summary. This MTV-ish answer to the classic Candid Camera TV show features a Gen X (.. or Gen Y) type that wears a false Xhopper, wears a variety of hats and wigs and glasses, and is often not interesting, but makes people quite outrageous. As an example:. Kennedy invited a parent to a ""wedding"" to a man Kennedy is a bride, complete with full bridal gowns and long wigs. It means that you immediately understand that you are marrying a man who claims to no longer have ""beats and pieces"". The problem is that this schtick has gone so long that it obviously cannot fill the time. And Kennedy is as much fun as cod dead in the sun. The candid camera would have Kennedy running 3-4 scenarios to solve this problem. I know the show wasn't made for me. JACKASS is made for a 12-year-old pin head who thinks today is the height of a comedy. So smile. Thank God for the show's end of life.","I think my summary states it all.

The problem is that this method is too time consuming and obviously cannot fill the time. And Kennedy is as funny as a dead cod lying in the sun.

"Frownland is like one of those furious embarrassing situations where you laugh out loud at exactly the wrong time. And the moment you realize that you shouldn't laugh, you've already reached the pinnacle of voice ringing.

When you want to scrape your gaze, you feel sorry for him. <br /> <br /> It was much easier to get out of Ronald Bronstein's movie, but a bit. There must have been a maniac, because I felt a firm determination to keep the course and experience the coarse particles the movie has to offer, if someone burns you, you usually want to put it out: stop falling and!! role! However, I would like to see the flames slowly wrap around the whole body through this film. You can stand the pain. Perhaps due to the unambiguous masochistic curiosity, you can't even try to explain it. However, if you have a chance to catch it, prepare yourself: prepare a puppy bag.","Frownland is one of the most embarrassing situations that makes you laugh out loud at the wrong time.

"I watched this movie while surfing infomercials and midnight 80's sitcoms on TV one night at 2 o'clock in the morning. I have to say that I didn't expect much and didn't get much. Rose McGowan was hot, but her performances and the rest of the cast weren't worth Oscar. There is relief in this movie and a nice twist at the end. But to be honest, it was terrible. Not even a typical slasher movie. There is no gore or sex, nudity, no real violence. Just bad behavior. I'll give 3 out of 10.","I saw this movie while surfing infomercials and late 80's comedy on TV. I must say, I didn't expect much and I didn't get much.

The movie has ups and downs, and at the end there are some nice twists, but to be honest, it was terrible. There isn't even a typical slasher movie. No gusset, no sex, no nudity, no violence. Just bad acting. 3 points out of 10 points."
"I first saw this movie when I was about 8 years old on TV in England. I was fascinated by the beautiful music that was never forgotten. It would have been the original dubbed version in English I saw-sometimes it was incorrectly referred to as ""Streamline Dub"" (in fact dubbing was provided by Ghibli itself and only distributed by Streamline). Box set. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I think some releases are broken in Disney. The voice acting is fine, but I don't think there is a primitive energy like ""streamline"" dub or original Japanese in the conversation, and I think James Van Der Beek is too old to play the lead. They made meaningless changes, such as changing the name of the main character from ""Pazu"" to ""Patzu"", and added a few conversations. But the worst thing is, I think they ruined a lot of the scenes with the music they interrupted. For example, the start of the airship was originally silent, but was ruined by Disney's moral requirement to play music whenever someone didn't speak. Annoying in many Disney movies. <br /> <br /> This movie still blows up the most recent animated movie, and I can't recommend it enough. The plot is simple yet attractive, and the movie shows a sad sensation in most modern mass markets, homogenized animation.","I first saw this movie when I was eight years old on British television (a place known as Laupta: The Flying Island). I absolutely loved it and was disappointed when it was repeated over time and missed it. I was fascinated by the story and characters, but most of all, I was fascinated by the beautiful and unforgettable music. It would have been the original English dubbed version I saw-sometimes erroneously called ""Streamline Dub"" (Dub was actually distributed by Ghibli himself and only by Streamline) Box set not sadly available except not as part of an expensive laser disc. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the release feels partially undermined by Disney. Voice acting is okay, but the dialogue does not have the ""streamline"" dub or the raw energy of the original Japanese. It seems that James Vanderbeek is too old to play Reed. They made some nonsensical changes, such as changing the hero's name from ""Puzz"" to ""Pats"" and added some dialogue. But worst of all, I think they ruined many scenes with disturbing music. The airship's opening scene, for example, was originally quiet, but was messed up by Disney's moronic requirement that music play whenever anyone is not talking. It's annoying in many Disney movies. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie as it still blows away the latest animated movies. The plot is simple but captivating, and the movie shows a taste that is sadly lacking in modern mass-market homogenized animation."
"The film doesn't recall the message, ""The human is evil and the bad animal is sweet and flawless."" The fisherman (Surprised) took away the killer whale, a very bad thing, but accidentally (if correctly marked) hits a pregnant cow instead of a friend's cow and uses the word in every sense. Apparently a sick psychopath and the formal villain of this piece is against a propeller trying to chew himself with the most painful and terrible things, not to mention the ineffective way of killing himself. When an unborn fetus aborts from a wound caused by his terrible self-harm, the spouse wakes up with revenge and hurts, kills and even damages the person talking to Nolan. Obviously, among humans, total psychopaths date other total psychopaths. <br /> <br /> This film is a semi-human message, ""Poor poor whale!! Evil people must suffer and die!"" Nevertheless, it never succeeded in demonizing Nolan. It is true that he was selfish and cruel when he set his motives, but when he first screams at the first whale he grows his heart and becomes more and more sympathetic to the pain of the whale until he appears to walk as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> Nolan's bizarre trip to the north to follow the whale in the last trip of the movie Melville's eerie human -. I made an interesting conclusion about the connection between whales and the fact that these two husbands have been connected to each other for a while to respect each other in their sorrows. Nolan is because his wife and an unborn child were also lost in an accident. It is clear that Nolan respects the whale and feels lost. But I never go there. The whale character has no compassion or zone center for anyone. <br /> <br /> The last scene loses this focus, and the sea monster finally kills everyone and Nolan and undoubtedly acts like a chin through the director. To grab and hold the whale (he snaps his head a bit earlier) I love animals, hate whaling, and love the orca whale more, but if the goal of this movie is to make me feel like it, then the whale was a victim and people It was completely unsuccessful to be wicked and to blame. Nolan shows compassion and growth, thinks of others, and what whales think is all about killing and mingling. <br /> <br /> The only message we can follow is ""If you see an Orca Whale, anytime, anywhere, if you misstep his FIN, it will move in a different direction. He will hunt you all the way to the end of the Earth, Will destroy it.""","The film can't decide whether the message is ""humans are evil and evil, animals are sweet and blameless"" or ""never go out in the water"". It's very bad for a fisherman (Nolan) to go out to catch a killer whale, but if I happen to (prematurely mark you) hit a pregnant cow instead of her companion, I Uses words in every sense-apparently a sick Psychovic and an orthodox villain of this work-trying to bite into the most painful and scary thing, let alone the ineffective way of killing himself Throw yourself at the propellers you want. (I don't think it was her first.) When a fetus miscarried from her horrifying self-harm wound, her companions went revenge and spiritually, and all humans even talking to Nolan. Vow to hurt, kill, and hurt. Obviously, like among humans, TotalPsych is dated with other TotalPsyco. <br /> <br /> ""Poor Poor Whale!! Evil Men Must Suffer and Die!"" Still, it hasn't succeeded in demonizing the Nolan at all. It is true that his motive was selfish and cruel, but with the first cry of the first whale he grew his mind, and as the film progressed, he became more and more caring for the whale's pain until he was able to walk. Have a whale on the ice to make you feel a little better. <br /> <br /> Nolan tracks the whale on a strange journey to the north The final journey of the movie reminds me Nolan is an eerie human in Melville because he lost his wife and unborn child in an accident. And a whale connection, and for a moment, a really interesting conclusion was hinted at. It is clear that Nolan respects whales and feels their loss. However, we do not go there. Whale characters have no compassion or respect for anyone. <br /> <br /> The last scene loses this focus, becomes like Joe's, and the sea monster eventually kills everyone and Nolan, and overlooks and becomes unsuspecting and fails. Hunt down a whale (he made a snug snap on her head some time ago) I love animals and I hate whaling. Moreover, although I love killer whales, the goal of this movie is to completely fail that whales are victims and that people are wicked and disgusting. Nolan shows compassion and growth, feels others, and whales are thinking of killing and destroying them. <br /> <br /> The only message I can leave with is, ``Somewhere when you see a whale whale, if you step on the FIN the wrong way, it will run in the opposite direction and you will reach the end of the earth. Hunt and destroy everything around you."""

"The confused and staggering conspiracy of irreconcilable disagreements constituted a mess that judged the life of one side and the other as the destroyers of the devil's seeds. Horror was excluded and replaced by terrible effects as a whole, which was considered horrible, but instead, the belief in mocking each other despite the title itself was wrong. This ridiculous plot, originally a fan of the masters of horror, smashed like a slender old rocking chair after sitting and sitting with a silly description. I see this episode thrown together from the start.","Tired of smelling disagreeable differences, the plot constituted a havoc of judgment, with one being a pro life and the other being a demon seed destroyer.

"Scott Menville is not Casey Kasem. This is the most important and most confusing thing in an attempt to reimagine Scooby-Doo and the company. The previous incarnation of the Scooby Show. They changed clothes and classic walking mode from the original outfit. <br /> <br /> No one is sure what the angle is still doing, but it's certainly the formula used in the previous Scooby Show. <br /> <br /> The anime style is very bizarre and distorted. I like it but it is not a real Scooby-Doo type animation. However, the strange animations used in other WB shows grew up for me. It's worth a look if you can deal with the lack of proper entangled and sulky voices. <br /> <br /> It's enough to cut one of those things that really enjoys the show. Besides, I am trying to be a flexible and tough fan. As the horse progresses, it evolves or dies. We'll see what it looks like after two episodes.

"I often wonder how these movies are made, and the most shocking part is that people actually pay to watch movies. No matter how stupid, he adds tweaks and turns when he likes. There was no subtle conversation in the script, such as ""Jo Sheena Roy pehenti hai, wahee fashion hota hai ""and ""Yeh Versace hai madam"" (yes, right). <br /> <br /> Each character is shallow and underdeveloped.

"Capra was quite accomplished early in the career through camera work and timing. This is a very thin story and sometimes predictable, but it has achieved very good performance in the cast and has a rather complicated camera movement that engages viewers intimately. The first part looks like a Cinderella story, but anyone with a brain knows that the floor will fall. The wealthy'prince' will lose his luck. It is easy to fall into a banal situation at a high speed. How married couples can earn a living. The movie is even more original because you have to find the ending is very predictable but pleased I also want to praise the title:. Very witty and fun.","Even at this early stage of his career, Capra was quite accomplished with his camerawork and his timing.

Still, it's easy to get caught up in the cliché for his good cast and at a fast pace. Then the movie becomes more original as the couple has to find a way to make a living. The ending is very predictable but satisfying. I also want to praise how to write the title. It's very witty and fun."
"Uwe Boll takes the filmmaking skills once again and offers science fiction stories about mercenaries and reporters aimed at super soldiers on remote islands. The cast, led by the outstanding Udo Keir, is a drift drifted by Ball, creating the worst script. The mad scientist who is being investigated by the reporter has reached the death, but this script is so interesting that the plot worked, the effect with dead lifeless eyes and the design of the super soldier is somewhat creepy, but the ball somehow sees the movie. Management. Use all methods. It's as if you've figured out what's actually working, and instead have weakened your inventory camera placement and couldn't go far. Also, there is no spark or life in the assembly of the scene. I think Boll only filmed one or two takes and used what he had. It really smells. Obviously, Boll is one of the regular retroactive movies that pours out what he has learned about the film. The last movie he made so bad was Seed's serial killer movie. It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This isn't bad, but it's better, so it's close. Again Udo Keir sees a scene that is worth his effort and makes this movie almost bad. Unless it's late at night, if you don't take the cable, you get a pass.","Uwe Boll looks back at his filmmaking skills again and provides a sci-fi horror story of a mercenary and a reporter joining a Super Soldier on a remote island. The alright cast, led by the talented Ud Kiel, is drifting by Bol, who made the worst script that should work.

In addition, there is some eerieness in the dead eye-catching effect and the design of the super soldier, but Boll manages to shoot it all in one hand. It's as if you've left the stock camera rattling, without knowing what's going on. In addition, there is no spark or life to assemble the scene. I think Bol only shot one or two takes and used only what he had. It really smells. Obviously, Bol is one of his regular retrograde movies, and it tells us everything he learned about the movie.

"It's amazing that such a clichéd movie Wiffy Fury movie was actually made from scratch.

"I'm a fan of old horror movies, and as a middle age, films produced before the 1970s were produced from the 1920s to the 1960s. I'm not a fan of more modern horror movies and it was great except for Creepshow 1. I can recall the story, but I really enjoyed the monster in the box story with Hal Holbrook. And it was a great ending for a really clean person. All the stories were great. Why did I like it so much? The character has made some progress, the line was very clear about who was good and who was bad, the fear bit was raised up close to the face with horror and the fun bit was really fun! This sequel lacks or lacks these elements significantly. I'm writing something I only saw this partly because the movie is a complete waste of time and I turned it off to do other things like writing movie reviews on IMDb.com, lol.

Not good for movies where nothing else is happening. If you can see dying, it will show up on the Encore cable channel.","I'm a big fan of old horror movies, and I'm middle-aged, so most of the movies I made before 1970, from the 1920s to the 1960s. I'm not a big fan of more modern horror movies, but Creepshow 1 was an exception. I was able to recall the story there, but I really enjoyed the box story monster with Halholbrook and the story about a really pretty guy was a great ending. All the stories were great. So why did you like so much? The character was to some extent decently developed and the lines about who were good and who were bad were very clear, horror bits were elevated with close-ups of horrifying faces, and funny bits are really funny! This sequel either lacks these elements significantly or does not exist at all. The movie was a complete waste of time, so I'm writing this only in part.

"I just wanted to say. I liked this movie automatically because I like Gheorghe Muresan. Billy Crystal is an excellent actor, even annoying.

"I thought this movie was incredible. There weren't many brothers, but I absolutely loved it. The special effects are excellent and this movie is about my favorite sport. golf.

It was all you could expect from a movie. I just liked it. Also, it was very child friendly. I realized that this movie can be anything you like. I will give pure 10/10!

"Here, some have mentioned that this is the worst Elvis movie ever made. Well, they are partially correct. For me, this is the worst movie ever made!

There is no ambitious fun to be here, as in other bad movies from Elvis like Clambake. This is so painful that it is painful. Pure garbage.

"Donald Pleasance and Peter Cushing have been unified into one horror film. It always sounds like a great plan. The most versatile cult actors of the two generations, previously paired together in a great genre excursion such as ""The Body and the Devil"" and ""From the Tomb Beyond"", paired with a footprint of Satan-themed exploits in the mid-70s. How can this be wrong? Unfortunately it is possible. To the deepest regret, ""The Land of Minotaur"" is not an ordinary person, and despite the cast, exotic environment, charming title and potentially great sound premise. Several tourists have disappeared as Baron Peter Cushing and his docile followers continue feeding the extinguishing Minotaur statue, in a small remote area of ​​Greece, especially near archaeological sites. Cushing, who seemed more boring and uninterested in some of his previous roles, owns a huge medieval castle and apparently in Greek this means complementary archaeological sites and underground cave networks. Of course it's very useful if your hobby kidnaps random campers and amateur archaeologists. When three of his young friends mysteriously disappear from the same area, Father Roach (formerly a city bride) decides to investigate. ""The Land of Minotaurs"" is a tedious and very slow horror effort that does not make any major attempts to create Satan's atmosphere and potentially does not detail all the fascinating elements and pagan details. For example, the tentacle Minotaur is an interesting creature in Greek mythology with a bull's head and a human body, but for unexplained reasons the script never deepens meaning. Instead, the film focuses on tedious and overly verbal sequences and inappropriate music that has turned into experimental noise; the only reason to give this movie a big disappointment is Donald Fleckten, a rude, powerful, old-fashioned priest who criticizes the strings. As always, his tombstone","A horror movie that combines Donald Pleasance and Peter Cushing. It always sounds like a great plan.

The most versatile cult actor in. Why is this not working? Unfortunately, it is possible. Unfortunately, ""the land of Minotaur"" is not even trivial. It's a premise of exotic settings, fascinating titles, and potentially great sounds despite the cast. In remote parts of Greece, especially near the archeological site, several tourists have disappeared as Baron Peter Cushing and his obedient followers continue to feed the scorching Minotaur statue. Cushing has never been more boring and indifferent to the role he played, but owns a huge medieval castle. Apparently in Greek this means that it also owns an underground network of complementary archaeological sites and caves. Of course, this is very handy if your hobby is random camper vans or the abduction of amateur archaeologists. When three of his young friends mysteriously disappeared in the same area, Father Roch, a former city priest, decided to investigate. ""Land of the Minotaur"" is a boring and very slow horror effort that never actually makes a big attempt to create a satanic atmosphere, and details of potentially fascinating elements and pagan trivia. I'm not going to explain it in detail. For example, the title Minotaur is an intriguing creature of Greek mythology with a bull's head and a human body, but for some incomprehensible reason, the script does not add to its meaning. Instead, the film focuses on boring, over-speaking sequences and loud, inappropriate music modified by experimental noise. Donald Pleasance is the only reason to even consider making the film's big disappointment an opportunity. Rude, criticizing everything that represents the modern youth, his portrayal of the great and old-fashioned priest is as powerful and reliable as ever."
"The three shorts included in this compilation, published in 1959, are the eternal Chaplin classics, and there is nothing wrong with them and no criticism. The framework added as a bridging section between Chaplin's scores and shorts for these films also performed well. The problem with this compilation is trivial, but annoying. The shorts are stretch printed to fit 24 frames. Whereas the speed of modern cinema, shorts itself where filmed in 20 frames. This result was a solution that was excusable, with many inconspicuous movements, but considering the limitations of optical printing technology at the time. The current DVD version is not restored and the film cannot look dirty as it is. Even in 1959, the stretch was still printed. You can also restore these classic versions separately from DVD and it doesn't matter to restore the image, but sadly this didn't work. <br /> <br /> A lot of minor shakes occurred.

"British newspaper reviews seem to have focused on the fact that reviewers tend to know Toby Young, a journalist about the actual experience of this film. The key word here is ""base"". The way to lose friends is the virtual Romcom. <Br /> <br /> Sidney Young joined the famous gossip magazine in New York and finally started making giraffes after giraffes before getting the right results. This includes selling him out, and the film has a serious point about journalism integrity. However, they are not excessive. The main material remains a comedy around Sydney's adventures. The script has a cake, and Sydney becomes a wise and moderately original skilled writer while being a silly and meaningful bulge. This contradiction is never a big deal because Simon Pegg (Sidney) predicts preferences too well. Regarding Sydney's affectionate object and Megan Fox (who plays Airhead Jumbo Starlet), I can only say this. If you say Fox, Miss Fox, you will leave your wife and sell all your belongings and buy yourself. Airplane tickets to take my place next to you on your side. Of course, my suggestion is not too tempting to be a 56-year-old obese English accountant, but it's on the table anyway. Given how short her career has been so far, you might think that it is too fast for Megan Fox to act ruthlessly revealing the kind of actress she is supposed to be. With skill and very sexual. This girl will go away. <br /> <br /> Supported by a number of seasoned performers, including Miriam Margolyes and Bill Paterson from the UK, Gillian Anderson from the United States, and Danny Huston. <br /> <br / >There were a few noisy moments in laughter, and I seem to have the most smiles, but at least two are very fun.","British newspaper reviews seem to focus on the fact that reviewers tend to know Toby Young, a journalist who wrote about the film's real-life experience.

Naturally, there is no original plot, but does it make sex with Gore stand out? No Gore flashes and misses affair and sex teases everyone. (James Spader mentions he needs a shower, and a delicious Leslie Stephanson asks to be with him. He rejects her. AGGH!) Yes. Don't go bankrupt if you want a nice woman in a white swimsuit that goes around the Antarctic research base. <br /> <br /> With a real thrill of about 30 seconds in the whole movie, Alien Hunter is a serious and slow progression to a sci-fi adventure. In need of a much better plot, the aliens themselves are incredibly clichéd, and those who share half of the title have little screen time. <br /> <br /> I also asked while watching what with the children of corn in a space motif. (Note that after Jason of the 13th fame, Hellraiser's Pinhead and Leprechaun weren't cornfields, they traveled into space to kill teenage teenagers.) <br /> <br /> But it would have been interesting and obviously opposed to this film covenant Will.

It needed a much better plot twist to bring it to life, and by the way the aliens themselves are horrifying cliché crafts, with virtually no screen time for anyone sharing half the title. <br /> <br /> I also asked while I was looking at what a universe-motif kids corn is. (Note that since Jason Jason on January 13, Pinhead and Leprechaun from Hellraiser have all traveled to space to kill teenagers, not cornfields.) Like Logan's Run Extra The cornfield character was waiting for the stem. <br /> <br /> But it was exciting and clearly against the contract for this movie.

"Lorna Green (Janine Reynaud) is a performing artist for wealthy intellectuals in local clubs.

Please start. After a murder in a fantasy, Rona wakes up in a dream to see if her privileges have happened in reality. <br /> <br /> In Franco, if someone asked how to describe this particular piece, I would like to say that it is elegant and difficult. So far, you probably have read other users' opinions due to the content of this movie. This is because most of the movies are made in a surreal atmosphere of dreams. In an interview, Franco noted that he was heavily influenced by Godard, ranging from filmmaking style to the beginning of his career, and decided to give up a clear narrative structure to create a completely different type of viewing experience. And, when you read the reaction of user comments here, some people look for a labor, dull and stupid style, like these decisions. I will admit that the movie is on my head for the first time, but when I solved the quiz by critics who watched ""Succubus"", even Franco himself admitted that he did not understand the movie and directed him! Some may argue that ""Succubus"" is just a pioneer of ""Venus in Furs"", which is considered Franco's faithful masterpiece. Because it adopts a surreal and dreamlike structure where the main character doesn't really know himself. She is experiencing something real or imaginary. In a sense, like the main character, we are experiencing the same type of confusion. Certainly, ""Succubus"" is an unconventional film production where we are not given the key to exactly what's going on. And many vague conversations do not solve the problem. ""Succubus"" is also in the Beatnik format and the commando film ""A Bucket of Blood"". It's full of ""poet-speaking"" My personal favorite scene is to tease in the lesbian gap between Lorna and the girl she meets at a posh party Mannequin used somewhat unusually. Becoming a strange fantasy sequence. Great location and jazz score. I can understand why this movie gets negative reactions, but I liked this movie.

The film shows the usual knotted horror death character that made him famous on TV and movies for years. This may have been Notts' last good excursion. When you have another 90 minutes, win Don Notts, a great icon of good laughter."
"Emma is a terrible flawless movie based on the classic novel by Jane Austens. I didn't read this book, so I didn't know much about the plot, but still predicted the whole plot. There were many scenes that frustrated me because of poor writing or direction. The movie is very enjoyable for any reason and I liked it. Of course, there were all the scenes that I hate, but the majority are well acting and fun. Guinness Paltrow is Emma's heroine and offers one of her best performances. The film also features Tony Collet (who liked it, but it's a lot better) relaxation Mecgreger (who was better but still very good here) Alan Cumming (who wasn't really impressed and almost the same here) and Jeremy Northam (whose performance is It was rather a tree at first, but it's actually subtle, but it's pretty subtle even when it's not needed.) There was a much better adaptation of the Jane Austen book, but it's still very fun and worth watching.","Emma is a terribly flawed film based on Jane Austen's classic novel. I've never read a book, so I didn't know much about plots, but nevertheless almost predicted the whole plot. The writing and production were bad, so there were many occasions when I was irritated. This movie is somehow very funny and I loved it. Of course, there were all the scenes I disliked, but most of them were played and it was fun. Gwyneth Paltrow gives one of her best performances as Emma's heroine. The movie also starred Toni Collette (anyone is okay, but much better) Ewan Mecgreger (everyone is good, but he's still very good) Alan Cumming (what I really admired) There's almost nothing here) and Jeremy Northam (whose performance is pretty wooden at first, but it's actually pretty subtle if not needed) Much better than Jane Austen's book There were some mods, but this one is still very entertaining and worth a look."

"Thank God because this is not a real story. Before The Devil, where the Fall is filled with sneaky figures who don't know the limits, is a fascinating, jaw-dropping journey that can be fun, sometimes funny, and sometimes even degraded by miserable tragic retention due to human dysfunction. It was not carried out with such a grand and overwhelming belief by the stars. Great script from Kelly Masterson and other great guidelines other than Sydney Lumet. It doesn't hurt Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke decided to rob their parents' jewelry store ""Charlie: Two days before the robbery."", no one should be confused Some people like this device. I said no, but I thought it worked perfectly in addition to the whole skewer, considering that the two brothers in question are not playing with almost all decks. Poker hand to save your life.

I hate my father (a powerful performance by Albert Finney) and the Shakespeare/Greek tragedy is in your hands. Proceed with caution.","Thank God This was not based on a true story.

"The film was held from start to finish, and the black and white photos taken in the heart of the United States are amazing. We feel like we're with them when they cross a large celestial country and cross over to Mexico and then back to the United States. At the end of the movie, the rain on Robert Blake looks like a little sweat and tears pouring on his face. Eventually, we follow the stairs to their last minute. <br /> <br /> The two criminals performed by Perry Smith and Dick Hickock by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson can be seen on any street in any city. Hickock is Smith, a smiling boy next door and a star in the eye on the other side of the city. This point was made in the movie, and the criminal always surprises him that he is no different in appearance from others. Even the worst, evil is part of the human state. These two delusions kill the whole family and find a vault not there. Once they run away, they start writing bad checks, paving the way for authorities. There are many great support actors. John Forsis likes Alvin Dewey, the detective in the case. Also, Will Geer, a prosecution lawyer, shines in a short but great scene. I finally got it after buying a DVD. The result is the best classic crime movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this gorgeous movie.

"This is a great show that is completely fresh and innovative.

Perhaps Johnny Carson's pattern copied by everyone, Latterman, Leno, Conan. ..

"Now I've read negative reviews of this show on this website and to be honest I was scared. Everyone doesn't know what the world is because they think soprano is not a television. To tell you, I started watching many TV shows like Lost, Prison Break, Dexter, Deadwood, and even Invasion. But the first season, especially the Lost and Prison Break, has lost touch on all shows since the company refused to watch because it was stolen by taking two genius ideas and creating more than one season. Then there is the soprano. I can honestly say that this is the only television series I've seen where I've been devoted all season, and more importantly, in all episodes. Excellent in this show. There is no department that has not acted -. Nothing is the best James Gandolfini is one of my favorite actors and I think his acting is absolutely shocking when HBO hears that Ray Liotta wants to play Tony but the first few. After looking at people, I thought it was a better choice. In the episode, I found out that HBO played a big role in casting James to Tony. The raw emotions he shows are great. Then we have Edie Falco, Michael Imperioli, Lorraine Bracco, Dominic Chianese (who remembered as Johnny Ola in Godfather 2) and personally favorite characters Tony Sirico and Steve Van Zandt Paulie'Walnuts' Gualtieri and Silvio Dante. All of these actors perform with the highest quality and provide excellent performance in every episode. Then we have a story. I have never been in a TV show before. This story is never great. Each episode was excellently directed and the score on this show is fantastic. I think soprano is a show that will be seen again and again and will never be boring. It's got everything from jolly humor to brutal violence, but nevertheless it's always best to grace the television. And I challenge someone to find real flaws in the show. I say it's too violent or I feel Tony's personality is immoral. It finally means a mafia performance. I don't think the character will be honest or loyal to God. I beg everyone to watch this show because I believe you will fall in love in the first episode. I first got a few friends who refused to watch the show. Trust me when you say this show is a gift from God compared to the garbage on TV. After watching the first season, I'll agree with you once again saying that this show dominates the television and doesn't do it. The present or future will lose the wonder of sopranos.","Now I read some negative reviews of this show on this website, and frankly I was surprised. For everyone who thinks soprano is not TV, I don't know what the world is all about. Let me tell you. We've started watching many TV shows, including Lost, Prison Break, Dexter, Deadwood, and even Invasion. But all those shows lost their touch after the first season, especially Lost and Prison Break, where the company took two genius ideas and slaughtered them by making multiple seasons. I refuse to watch because I did. Next is soprano. To be honest, this is the only TV series I have ever seen, and the only TV series I have ever seen, and more importantly, all its episodes. There is no division that this show is not good at. James Gandolfini is one of my favorite actors and I think his acting is absolutely amazing in every episode after HBO asked Ray Liotta to play Tony. In the episode, I knew that HBO did a great job of casting James as Tony. The raw emotions he displays are great. Then Eddie Falco, Michael Imperioli, Lorraine Bracco, Dominique Chianese (I remembered as Johnny Ola in the Godfather Part 2) and my two favorite characters, Tony Sirico and Steve Vanzanto Pauly ""Walnut"" Guartieri. And Silvio Dante. All of these actors perform at the highest quality and perform well in all episodes. Next is the story. I've never been hooked on TV shows. The story is nothing short of wonderful. Each episode is supervised and the scores on this show are amazing. Soprano is one of the shows that I've watched over and over again and never get tired of. It got everything from hilarious humor to brutal violence, but it's still the best thing to make a television graceful and I challenge anyone to find the real flaw in the show. I don't think I'm too violent, I feel Tony's character is immoral, I feel like a mafia show in the end, I'm not honest or faithful to God. Believe it, you get hooked from the first episode, I was, and my friends who initially refused to watch the show got hooked on it. Believe me if this show is a gift of God compared to the crap you see on TV. After you watch the first season, you inevitably agree with me when this show once again dominates television and is not a television show. Now or in the future, we will perform the soprano marvel."

"Most people have no idea that this movie exists. The fox, who paid the judge, kept it in a can for quite some time and then used nothing for promotion. It made people think that it was one of the garbage films that was pouring out in late summer. Well, I'm here to say that this is a fun and rather scary look for a future that is hard to believe in you. Basically, the judge thinks that a foolish person is wisely clever. These fools are basically more stupid by making more stupid people by watching TV or having sex all the time. Today, a man of average intelligence, 2500 would seem to be a genius who tells ""all ambiguous"" stories. Seriously, this is really hard to believe. Of course, this future is painful, fun and stupid, but still plausible. Luke Wilson is great for military trips, trying to get back to a more comfortable time. Where this story gets its cult status comes with numerous funny 1 liners like ""Can we make her a family style?"" This film is an interesting film about American society and is a rather social commentary that seems to be doomed by self-interest, comfort and foolishness. And over.","Most people are totally unaware that this movie exists. Fox, who paid the judge and made money, kept it in a can for a while and spent nothing to promote it.

Basically, the judge advocates the idea that fools far outsmart the wise. Then these fools are getting stupid by watching TV and having sex basically all the time. By the year 2500, a person of current average intelligence will look like a genius who says ""everything is wrong"". Seriously, is this really unbelievable? Granted, this future is painful, weird, and ridiculously stupid, but still plausible. Luke Wilson is great as a time-traveling soldier, desperately trying to return to a more comfortable time.

"This is a wonderful and funny horror film that captures the essence of the obsession with evil metal music from the mid to late 80s. I can remember being surprised by a metal teenager when I was young. When I was ten, finding a rotten grave in my hometown cemetery doesn't help. This strange little metal boy dug an old body and used a strange sacrifice bone to Satan. Maybe 24 hours later I didn't like it, but I like it. But surprisingly it dominated. It's about the extreme evil powers of metal. And you should like the scene where the guitar shoots the lazer and vaporizes the headbangers in the crowd. This movie is awesome. If you like metal and bad movies from the 80s, this is for you. 9/10!","This is a ridiculous horror film that captures the essence of the obsession with the badness of metal music in the mid-80s. I remember being astonished by teenage metal when I was a kid. It doesn't help that I found the blasphemous grave in my hometown cemetery when I was 10. It turns out that this strange metal kid dug up an old body and used Satan's bones for a strange sacrifice. So it might be like keeping me away from metal for a while, but I love it, when I'm 24. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD used for $6, but to my surprise it dominated. It's all about the devilish power of metal. And you have to love the scene where the guitar fires a laser in the crowd to vaporize the headbangers. This movie is great.

"It is not as good as A Murder is Announced, but it not only surpasses the book, it almost surpasses the book. This is a great adaptation. And I know a significant improvement from the Geraldine McEwan version. Now I am not proud to wear a bad mouth to Geraldine McEwan adaptation. Two or three were surprisingly good, but the others started well, but were ruined by poor scripts, confusing final solutions, or both. The Geraldine McEwan version suffered from explosive speed and two problems above and will consider the second worst of the ITV adaptation. In the worst case, Sittaford Mystery is dull and confusing despite its own merits. This adaptation of the book Nemesis is a great freedom, and despite some freedoms, it not only respects the book, it almost fixes the problems of the ITV version. Lionel's additional personality seemed rather annoying, but it was related to the way he acted rather than the way he acted, and despite one or two slow pacing intervals, this is certainly a decent adaptation of the book. It was beautifully shot with great photos and details of the times, and the music is always great. This show is great this time and Joan Hickson is always great like Marple Miss, and takes advantage of the generally well done scripts using the robust rotations of Liz Fraser, Helen Cherry, Joanna Hole and Anna Cropper. Margaret Tyzack excels at cold and moving performances like Cclothilde. Worth seeing overall, better than the latest version of almost every department. 9/10 Bethany Cox","It's not as good as A Murder is Announced, but it's not only fun, it's almost beyond the book, but it's a great adaptation. And what you know, it's a great improvement on the Geraldine McEuan version. Right now, I'm not proud to swear on Geraldine McEwan's adaptation. Two or three of them were surprisingly good, while others got off to a good start, but were ruined by poor scripting, a confusing final solution, or both. The Geraldine McEwan version suffers from both a rapid pace and both of the above issues, and I considered the ITV's second worst problem, the worst case Sittaford Mystery. This adaptation of the book ""Nemesis"" is a huge improvement, not only respecting the book despite some freedom, but also fixing a lot of the problems the ITV version had. Lionel's added character came across rather frustrating, but it's more about how he was written, rather than how he behaved, and a slow pace of one or two times. But this is solid as a decent book adaptation. Beautifully shot, with lovely photos and timely details, the music is always excellent. The performance this time is great, with Joan Hixon as great as Miss Marple, and solid turns from Liz Fraser, Helen Cherry, Joanna Hall, and Anna Cropper, making the most of commonly-used scripts. The Margaret Tizak delivers a moving performance that freezes like a crosshill. Overall worth a look and it outperforms recent versions in almost every department. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

"This movie is one of my favorite foreign movies, and the other movies are Amilee and My Life As a Dog. Like many foreign films, the similarity with that film is that it takes a piece of ordinary life and turns it into a deep, polite lesson. <br /> <br /> In Japan, a bored man stuck in the frame of ordinary life and marriage sees a beautiful Japanese woman looking out the window of a dance studio. The moment the train passed, he was fascinated by her. But is it because of her beauty, a distant gaze, or both, a connection to discover what they share? <br /> <br /> Shall We Dance has a wonderful and memorable character who has to deal with painful reality beyond the dance world. Everyone in the traditional and Japanese society is at risk of happiness and finds that joy is not so far. It is one of the very magical and meaningful films, and by itself, transcends the ordinary by showing the true magic and miracles that life can do.","This movie is one of my favorite foreign movies, and some others are Amilee and My Life As a Dog.

"Just as the movie itself is worthless, this is a great way to get an overview of a novel as a preface to reading it. In the summer of 1968 I watched a movie in New York. I read my first book in the fall in graduate school. Part of the pleasure of reading the novel was the memory of an incredibly detailed movie. And I've been reading and teaching novels for over 30 years, and better or worse, Milo O'Shea is still a Leopold Bloom.","As if the movie itself was worthless, this is a great way to get an overview of the novel as a preface to reading it.

"This film is an lyrical and romantic memoir from an 11-year-old boy living in a rural Cuban village through the snow during the Castro Revolution. It is definitely a true worthy labor of love. <br /> <br /> The names CUBA LIBRE and CUBAN BLOOD are just an attempt to mis-sell this as an action movie. Julia's dream makes a lot more sense. It's more common with European movies than RAMBO, and the revolution only inconveniences people's daily lives and pursuits. This fact alone can make a movie more honest than most of the works that cover this period in Cuban history. A clip in a Hollywood movie that speaks much more visually than a narrator can. <br /> <br /> It is a fair game as the movie becomes depressed while depressingly waxes the movie. A way of life that surpasses lost love. <br /> <br /> Like the movie Julie, the revolution seems endless.","The film is a lyrical and romantic memoir that was transmitted through the eyes of an 11-year-old boy living in a rural town in Cuba during the Castro Revolution.

"When ZP was first released, I saw ZP and found great disappointment. The script is intense, arched and seems to be fake in the 60s too. It is too advanced politics and ridiculous politics. And let's face it, I was still under the spell of love known as BLOWUP, and I didn't shake it completely. Now ""love"" is twisting with all sorts of perfumes that it evokes... good luck to me! <br /> <br /> But time passed, time was kind to ZP, and time was a teacher to me. I revisit this movie about every 10 years and getting better as I get older. ZP is his ""experience"" and is only really connected to BLOWUP through his late and great Antonioni. <br /> <br /> 12 years ago, I was lucky to see a completely clean look. Printed in the correct size (intense size) restored by the Italian governmental cultural institution, who knows good works when looking at art and knows that it is important to keep such beauty in good shape. To this day, I remember the crowd's bluff when the first scene of Death Valley appeared. It's like the visual impact of a thousand volts that Antonioni deliberately awakened us to a new level of awareness. And what actually follows at that point is a completely different kind of ""place."" <br /> <br /> What is surprising to me is how this movie goes into itself. <br /> <br /> Secondly --- In the early 80s --- I started to feel affection for the whole movie, especially Daria and Mark. On the other hand, they both fascinated me, especially because these two seemed like the smart versions of Alexandria's shadows from Zefferelli's Olivia and Leonard (read Romeo and Juliet). She took time... to live. Everything dies around her. <br /> <br /> Exciting the theater, the daylight of reality began to erase my new discovered ""pleasure"" quickly. The 80's big head with an invasive shoulder pad whispered, ""But it's hippie fantasy. Let's go."" <br /> <br /> The power of Antonioni's vision has already been realized. ""Uh-Huh"" answered ""80s"", secretly owned and jealous, keeping my ""love"". <br /> <br /> But this is a good art living in you, and if you want it, secretly, jealous, possessively love you again and ""love"". And you are ""changed"". <br /> <br /> We were delighted to see Tuner Classic Movies' decision to show ZP in the March lineup. Undoubtedly, the ZP must only be visible on a huge screen to move to the actual configured environment. Sometimes, however, even a peek of a loved one in a newspaper picture is no better than a peek at all. <br /> <br /> Today's hitting reality has been mysteriously withdrawn from ZP and replaced by Winnie Tick from ALICE'S RESTAURANT. <br /> <br /> So it's still so hard, so hard, what? <br /> <br /> Like any good art, everything dies around it. <br /> </br />","I saw ZP when it was first released and it was a big disappointment.

The Italian government's cultural institute knows the fine art works when restored and when seen, and knows the importance of keeping such beauty in good shape.

And you “change”. <br /> <br /> I was thrilled to see Turner Classic Movie deciding to show ZP in its March lineup. Without a doubt, ZP has to look on a huge screen and can really take you to a built environment.

"It's a very strange but sometimes elegant exploitation film with no real stories, but you can take advantage of the surprisingly terrible starring actors and a handful of nice and terrible makeup effects. Daniela is a beautiful 20-year-old girl who suffers a raped rape when she is 13 years old. Nightmares and hallucinations make her more convinced that she is the reincarnation of a female ancestor who is considered a werewolf. At a night meeting, she kills her daughter-in-law and is presented to the hospital. But she escapes again and swallows more men randomly while running for police detectives, doctors and relatives. It's cute to see and hear (actually a great soundtrack), but without plot and continuity, it gets very fast. Luckily, the main woman Annik Borel wears little clothes and dances naked around the fire, filling in boring moments. The movie is too long, too strange and unforgettable. Director Rino Di Silvestro was the biggest surprise when he suddenly and blue disappeared.

"This is an interesting and hard-to-find film that does not cut like a marine as a young man starring Jan Michael Vincent in the early 70s. When they are sent home, unsuccessful recruits in'Baby Blue' costumes are packaged and sent to insult them. Vincent stops at a bar and encounters a very young Richard Gear who returned to the hardcore marine'radar' on a tour of the Pacific Ocean. Gere's character is already desolate and distressed, taking advantage of Vincent's innocence, then hitting him on the alley and stealing the'Baby Blue' uniform. The character of Vincent, named Marion, was dressed in Gere's costume and suddenly changed to Marine' Raider'. Marion walks the road to Wyoming and stops in a small town like Norman Rockwell. At a local cafe, he immediately meets the eye-catching Rose Hudkins. Marion, along with Hudkins' parents, attracts the attention of the villagers. Hudkins doubts Marion and wonders how Marine'Raider' can be so innocent. The story also provides Japanese intern camps, with city people'hunting' three exits. During this hunt, Marion was accidentally shot. But there is still a happy ending. I would have preferred the drama a bit more! Anyway, this captures JMV at the peak of the 70's performance. The BUSTER AND BILLIE, BABY BLUE MARINE and WHITE LINE FEVER in the mid 70's were surprisingly good JMV performance. At the same time, he was an action star and heartbeat. He made many quality movies during his career and continued through the mid 80's with the great TV show Airwolf. He does a good job like'Hedge', quietly observing the way people wear their uniforms when traveling across the country. He would have done some of the stunt work. There is an intense river scene at the end of the movie. He looks like he's throwing the river at me! But in fact, when his popularity was high, the film was able to do much more with JMV's talent and looks. Innocence can be very interesting..... Evil is much more dramatic, as we've seen in ""Buster and Billie"" Anyway, Glynn Nice O'Connor is delighted like Rose The whole picture of the movie is like Norman Rockwell's picture The outdoor scene is gorgeous -. It must have been shot in Canada.","This is an interesting, hard-to-find movie of the early 70's starring Yan Michael Vincent as a youth who doesn't make a marine cut.

Gear's personality is already jerky and thinking of a breakout, and he took advantage of Vincent's innocence to steal his ""Baby Blue"" uniform after intoxicating him and hitting him in the alley.

Marion was accidentally shot during this hunt. But I still have a happy ending and I was a bit confused. I would have liked a little more drama! Anyway, this captures JMV at the peak of his 70s performance. Buster and Billy, Baby Blumarine and Whiteline Fever in the mid-70s were amazingly good JMV performances. He was an action star at the same time, and at the same time he was throbbing!!! During his career he made a lot of high quality films, which he continued on the great TV show Airwolf until the mid-80s. He did a very good job with this as a ""hedge"" and quietly observed how people treat him in his uniform as he travels around the country. He must have done some stunt work-there is a miserable river scene at the end of the movie-and he's like a man who threw a river at me! But in fact, due to his popularity, the film may have accomplished much more with the talent of JMV and his looks. Innocence can be very interesting. The evil explored in ""Buster and Billy"" is much more dramatic! Anyway, Glynnis O'Connor is as fun as Rose. The overall look of the movie is like a painting by Norman Rockwell. The outdoor scene is gorgeous-must have been shot in Canada."

"Jäniksen vuosi is one of the most political films in Zarba.

What makes Jäniksen vuosi exceptional, besides a visual and humorous brilliance, is a way to show Finland's political climate in the 70s and Finland's identity as a country.

"After seeing Dick Tracy in the Future Shop's $6.99 ark, I decided to become a big fan of mafia and crime movies without prior knowledge. I was very surprised to see a fun, smart and fun movie with great performance. The film works well and has another solid performance by Warren Beatty, but the real striking features of the film are Al Pacino and Madonna. I was delighted to learn that Pacino was named for his achievements as the best gangster trying to bring down the city. Madonna was a great man in trouble. She was really impressed and added depth to her performance. If you're in a position to watch a fun and smart movie with great acting and solid scripts, try Dick Tracy.

"The Mexican werewolf in Texas is located in Furlough, a small border town where Anna (Erika Pai) lives, her best friend is Rosie (Martin Hughes), a Mexican man named Miguel (Gabriel Gutierrez) who decides to chase the beast There are friends. They threatened the village and killed several villagers, including livestock and friends. Local Mexican legends talk about myths and legendary evil Chupacabra. Well, what Scott Maginnis has written and directed will not go over here. And the Mexican werewolf in Texas says it's terrible, period. This script refers to the word Werewolf only once and the rest refers to Chupacabra. In fact, this may not have been thought of as a werewolf movie. 'Wolf' creatures mostly look like hairless and fierce dogs, there are no mentions of people changing during the full moon, and they actually attack several times a day. There is no transformation scene, and dying at the end does not change anyone again. Apart from the title, there is no representation of the Werewolf movie at all, and the title is a torn from the most popular American werewolf in London (1981). This is a type of home-made trash that I personally think is killing the horror genre. The Dawn of Death (1978), Evil Death (1981), Halloween (1978) or Friday the 13th Friday (1980) are all made with shoelace budgets and may be the Blair Witch Project (1999). But recently, trash like the Mexican werewolf in Texas is unlikely to be considered a classic. The character is terrible, things happen around, the conversation is terrible, the gaps are terrible, the story is annoying and I actually fall asleep. This movie is completely garbage. Sorry but I don't know. <br /> <br /> Director Maginnis does nothing to make this visible. Unpleasant handheld camera type cinematography can easily give someone a headache and a quick'blink and miss something' edit. It's just annoying and irritating with equal annoyance. It is not scary, there is no excessive exposure, there is no tension or mood, and the special effects are terrible. The monsters look really poor, and it's not surprising that Maginnis keeps the shadows or cuts the scene too fast to see well. There are very few colors in the photo, it almost blacks or hurts your eyes over saturated desert sand oranges. Gore consists of fake intestines (blinking and you will miss them!), some bloody wounds and severed arms, and a great deal. <br /> <br /> With a budget of around $300,000, the budget is low, but I refuse to accept that there are many low budget horror movies with a high budget to make such junk movies. Everything has the look of a home movie, has no style & is dull and dull to view. The Mexican Werewolf in Texas may be mistaken for perhaps a sequel to John Landis' classic, so it will lead some to borrow/buy/watch it. <br /> <br /> Not the most obvious and not even the correct werewolf movie. Don't be fooled. This terrible & I'm tired of having to waste time/money on homemade amateur rubbish.","A Mexican werewolf in Texas is in a small border town, Farlow, where Anna (Ericaffei) lives, her best friend is Rosie (Martin Hughes), and she is determined to chase the beast.

A local Mexican legend talks about the mythical and legendary evil creature, the Chupacabra. Well, I'm struggling now, because so much else doesn't happen... , Simply the Mexican wolf in Texas says it's terrible, limit. In this script, once we mention the word Werewolf, we refer to the Chupacabra for the rest of the time, but I think it wasn't really considered a Werewolf flick at all. ""Werewolf"" creatures look almost hairless and look like a vicious dog. There are no mentions of people changing during the full moon, and they actually attack on a few occasions during the day, with no scene of transformation. Even if you are killed, no one will return. To be honest, apart from the title, there's nothing to show Werewolf movies here. Still, the title is a rip-off of London's popular American Werewolf (1981). This is a handmade crap type that I personally think killing the horror genre, Dawn of the Dead (1978), The Evil Dead (1981), Halloween (1978) or 13th Every Friday (1980) was created with a shoelace budget. Probably the Blair Witch project (1999), but in recent years & Texas wolf-like crap can never be considered a classic. Characters are terrible & things happen around them, conversations are trash, pacing is terrible, stories are sucked in and practically put me to sleep & overall this movie is just crap, sorry I don't know how else to explain it. <br /> <br /> Maginis does nothing to make this available. There's an annoying handheld camera-type cinematography that easily gives someone a headache and is a “blink and miss something” edit that's just as much annoying and annoying. I'm not afraid, I don't have any nudity, I'm not nervous, I have no special effects. The monster looks really meager, and it's no wonder you can't see it well, as Maginis holds it in the shadow or cuts his scene. The image has few colors. It's almost black, or it's on top of a saturated desert sand orange, which can hurt your eyes. Gore is made up of several fake internal organs (which you'll miss if you blink!), some blood wounds, arm amputations, and major problems. <br /> <br /> If the budget is about $300,000, the budget is low, but that there are many low-budget horror movies that simply turn their poor budget away to make such a rubbish movie. Refuse to accept. The whole looks like a home movie, but without style. Acting is a nasty thing, as you probably already know. <br /> <br /> The Mexican werewolves in Texas may mistakenly think it's a sequel to John Landis' classics, so they probably allow some to rent/buy/watch. That's definitely not the case, and there isn't even a proper Werewolf flick. Don't be fooled. This is terrible. Thus homemade amateurs are tired of wasting time and money on crap."
"I found this to be a surprisingly light touch in a 1950s cultural conflict movie. John Wayne isn't the first choice as a culture lover, he's close to a good-intentioned diplomat from Harrods as a bull. However, this time I played a much more passive part than the ordinary bluff persona and performed it in style. Duke was a man who could actually act well. His facial expressions and body language can be very subtle. <br /> <br /> Despite the actor's time and considerable presence as an actor, he did not rule the film. His good intentions were crops. He had no one in power, and the intermittent story was provided by the successor geisha, whom he was a barbarian. <br /> <br /> The story of the United States' attempt to favor Japan in isolationism is not a political conspiracy, but a swashbuckling or hellish leather battle. I can't comment on the accuracy of the research, but the strangeness of Western sensibility in Eastern culture was well revealed. There were numerous choreographed rituals that entailed what this observer would look like as true clothing and props. The set pieces were complex and detailed. A lot of money and thought was applied to it. <br /> <br /> The fractured romance between Wayne and his geisha adds a bit of extra elements and prevents the movie from trying to be political or waving flags. The script was good without being too verbose. There were many Japanese conversations, but the translation period was long, so it did not interfere with the story. It was great to see a lot of real Asians on the set. I couldn't say whether they were Japanese or not. But anyway they saw that part. Unlike other efforts like'Blood Alley' (Yes, I know they're Chinese),'The Sixth Happiness Inn' or even'King and I', I'm more of a back bar y dressed up than any other movie Enjoyed. It is recommended to start the script. I didn't like the song'The King And I', and I wasn't impressed by the heavy anti-communist subtext of'Blood Alley'. I confess that I have never seen this work, and I find it very advantageous compared to the more famous excursions from The Duke. <br /> <br /> Recommended.","This turned out to be a surprisingly handy touch in a 1950s culture crash movie. John Wayne isn't the first choice as a cultural lover because he's as good-willed and diplomatic as the robbers at Harrods. However, this time he was left to play a much more passive part than the regular Bluff persona, and he completed the task in style. Duke was a really good guy. His facial expressions and body language can be very subtle. <br /> <br /> He has failed to dominate the film, despite being a significant actor and showing time. Much of his goodwill came from farmers. He had no authority over anyone, and the intermittent stories were provided by a geisha in honor of which he was a barbarian.

"I was so happy to see this short film. I was always disappointed that it was difficult to meet a short film. So when I saw this and saw it selected for a live action short film at the Academy Awards, the <br /> <br /> plot actually was very simple. Director, writer, star Nacho Vigalondo came up with the reason why people suddenly sing and dance like a movie musical. The results are incredibly interesting and the song is actually very interesting. <br /> <br /> It's a well-made short film, well edited, and the actors all do a great job. And the final scene in the movie is perfect. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.","I'm glad I met this short film. I'm so disappointed because it's always hard to find short films, so watching this and seeing being nominated for an Academy Award live action short film, I actually got my own movie I was very pleased to have been done. I support you. <br /> <br /> The plan is very simple. The director, writer, and star Nacho Vigarondo sought to figure out why people suddenly jumped into songs and dance numbers, like the musical in the movie. The results are very interesting and the songs are really really catchy. <br /> <br /> It's a well made short film, well edited and all the actors do a great job. And the last shot in the movie is perfect. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie."
"I thought it would be a good movie before I started with this movie, but when I started the movie I found something terrible. They said the film was made in Afghanistan, but I think 95% of the film was filmed in India. You can see Indian cars. You can see lars drinking bisleri (Indian water brand), which is written on the road, and you can also see the temples in Afghanistan. I don't think you should waste your time watching this movie. Pure waste of time.. It's better to do something else without watching this movie. Otherwise, your mind may be better, but don't waste this time.","Before I started these movies, I thought it was a good movie, but when I started it I found it really terrible.

I encourage you to do something else rather than watch this movie."
"Really scary space wasting. Me and my friend tried to watch this movie to the end, but had to turn it off for about 30 minutes from the end. And with one hand, you can count off the movies you turned off before ending. <br /> <br /> Scripts and directions are very powerful and inspiring. You won't be surprised if they found the script in the cast off script since 1983. Seriously, the police knocked on the door in minutes. Scenes and events are washed by you like shit at the river. It is difficult to understand the actual thrust of the film. The narrative appears randomly as if it seems to break a pathetic attempt to create a character. Oh and they are ""characters"". Luke's hero is terrible. He may have just cut the cardboard and stayed in bed. After about 60 minutes of filming, I made an indifferent attachment to this character. He is not sympathetic or hateful. Deformed piles in the shop window misunderstand every scene. His motive is generally impossible to distinguish between less and less emotionless delivery. Is he happy? I'm so sad? angry? do not know. Those same dead eyes are staring at you in a deformed chunk of meat. And the theme of Native Americans is terrible and meaningless. <br /> <br /> Good people are almost impossible. Dull clerical stereotypes and simple nervous ex-wife stereotypes. Cue archetypal wife with a shotgun face-to-face with a bad guy, ""You won't shoot me"". It is rather original and annoying. Stimulate a one-sided psycho character. Rosario Dawson's character begins with a promise, but soon goes down to the ill-fated parody of the bully. <br /> <br /> The chick scene of Jackie Brown, Rosario Dawsons character. Do you want to believe that her character was attracted to Luke's charm? Or worse, is she floozy sleeping with moving objects? Realistic female character FTW! <br /> <br /> In short, the complete confusion of the movie. Desperate features and performances. Lead hacked script with uninspired directions. And ultimately very dull. Comedy is not bad either. Laughing at Luke Kess, the face gets pretty old after the first 15 minutes of it.","A really waste of space. Me and my friend tried to watch this movie to the end, but had to switch off in about 30 minutes from the end. On the other hand, you can also count the movies that were turned off before the end. <br /> <br /> The script and direction are guided and not very exciting. I wouldn't be surprised if they found the script in the pile of cast-off scripts since 1983. For example, a frustrating scrotum threatening a real estate agent from a home phone. Means seriously. The police would have beaten his door in a few minutes. Like river weeds, scenes and events are shed on you. Understanding the actual thrust of a movie is difficult. The story defeats the pathetic attempt to build characters and flicks between characters in a seemingly random way. Oh, what kind of ""character"" is it? The main character played by Rourke is terrifying. He may have sent a cardboard cut from himself and stayed in bed. After a movie of about 60 minutes, I had zero attachment to this character. He is neither sympathetic nor hateful. Dummy that doesn't look neat through the shop windows blurs all the scenes. His motive is indistinguishable from his generally crushed emotionless birth. Is he happy? Is he sad? angry? Just the same dead eyes, do not know, staring at you from a lump of flesh that has changed shape. And the Native American theme is terribly meaningless. <br /> <br /> Good people are impossible at best. A dull white-collar stereotype and a nervous ex-wife stereotype. A typical wife Kew with a shotgun confronts the bad guys and says, ""You aren't going to shoot me"", annoying rather than boring and original. <br /> <br /> The richie nix character seems funny at first, but soon inspires one-sided psycho characters. This seems inconsistent with the seeming intent to sympathize, or at least realistically motivate, the malicious person in some way. Jackie Brown chick scene. Want me to believe that her personality was so fascinated by Rourke? What's worse, is she a flirt that sleeps on moving things? Real female character FTW! <br /> <br /> In summary, the movie is a complete mess. Desperate features and performance. Leading, hacked screenplay and uninspired direction. And finally very dull. Comedy is not bad either. After sneaking through the muddy first 15 minutes of the movie, the laughing faces in the Loks look pretty old."

"We hope that ideas as good as ""Invisible People"" will be treated more carefully in a time of more effective and fantastic special effects. However, this is not true. The whole of the last 20 minutes of stories, characters and movies is as fresh as the mad scientist movie of the early 50's. There are great moments thanks to the amazing special effects and the idea of ​​the invisible person stalking the distance. But alas, soon we returned to the cramped space of the underground lab. Not only can you predict the rest of the movie, it's a schematic. <br /> <br /> There were many old remakes. Movies or TV shows from the past 10 years, and some of them are attractive. However, it is becoming clearer and clearer for each movie that the idea of ​​putting an ol' classic under the nose of a passionate maniac like Verhoeven is very bad for each movie. It is clear that money is an important issue. There is little time and energy to put into the script. As a result, ""Hollow Man"" is seriously damaged by clichés, graceful characters, predictability, and lack of depth. <br /> <br /> But it was a swear word that actually impressed me in addition to the special effects. When making this kind of movie, modern producers are very eager to let their children see it. Therefore, the language (sometimes violence and sex) is very low. When the whole world bursts, good people say, ""Oh!"" And ""Oh my god"". ""Hollow Man"" gratefully ignores that kind of hypocrisy and the character is free to say the most natural to him. I'm not saying that the most natural reaction to what's wrong is to swear. But in fact, if someone swears, you can trust it more. I think we can thank Verhoeven.","Some would want ideas as good as the ""Invisible Man"" to work well and be treated more carefully in the era of fantastic special effects, but this is not the case.

"Although there is a Pulp Fiction, it mainly has its own voice and identity because of the music video directional style, narrative like sketches and great performances. Like Thomas Jane (the drug dealer's confrontation is special), so is Aaron Eckhart. James LeGros has a short, effervescent appearance.

Thomas Jane is just as good as Aaron Eckert (the drug dealer showdown is extraordinary). James Regulos has a short and fierce look-great humor-""They Got Won's House"". The interrogation of Porzikova and the scene of rape are impressive, and Mickey Rourke's cameo appearance-""peaks"". <br /> <br /> Now, take the peak. It's worth it."

"The only thing I heard while growing up was equality of equality. Here we have a movie that not only shows the imbalance, but continues with the whole concept that one sex is better.

I had to turn the movie off where an old prostitute told Gene Male Adam that it was good to be a prostitute. In the past, I know that not ending it is a bad review of myself, but developing a story that might be of interest to viewers is the responsibility of the writers and crew, and it has failed.

Some are supernatural causes, such as John Carradine from Arthrtic Lurch (a small role provides the movie's only valuable moment). Next film director John Ireland was dismissed as superstitious Hokum. The results include ""Satan's School for Girls"" (famous title; TV production value; interesting plot) and ""Children should not play with the dead"" (low-wage film for low-wage filmmakers) to wake the dead); The problem is where it is fun or not. ""Seven Corpse's House"" died on Frame 1, and the rest of the 89 minutes dragged us through every minute, going through strict Mortis.","Well... now that I know where Rob Zombie stole the title of his ""1,000 dead body house"" Crapfest, I can rest assured now.

"Director Sidney Lumet has made some masterpieces such as Network, Dog Day Afternoon or Serpico, but he hasn't had much luck with his recent work; Gloria (1999) was pathetic and Find Me Guilty was interesting, but failed the experiment. Lumet brought the best movie in decades and from my point of view is a true masterpiece:. Before the devil knows you're dead, I think this movie is like Rummet's rebirth Philip Seymour Hoffman offers a great show as usual and undoubtedly one of the best actors of our time.Ethan Hawke Also a great actor, but he was underestimated in my opinion. His performances here are great. The rest of the rest of the cast is great (especially the great Albert Finney). Pathetic Oscar. The strength of the movie is excellent. The devil is a true masterpiece with perfect directions, great scenarios and excellent performances before you know you're dead.

"I turned 14 to watch this movie. We left after 15 or 20 minutes. It was absolutely terrible! This film must be at least R rated. I'm not very strict with movies, but too many. It was a waste of money. I thought it would include a comedy and I knew the comedy would be crude, but this was a way beyond crude oil. I was sitting there and reading (the specific subtitle at the beginning of the movie was what actually got me) and I couldn't believe how sexual it was.

"I can't easily find Judas Kiss on VHS (not available on DVD), but I wanted to add a rather vague movie to the Alan Rickman movie collection. <br /> <br /> Competent Mr. Did Rickman plunge into this ordinary movie? Judas Kiss boasts some cool actors, interesting plots and interesting tweaks, but odd visual wandering and crop editing may have turned into a serious crime drama. In many scenes, it seems that important information is missing to describe the character's behavior. Why did our hero immediately suspect his boss? Why did you distrust the substitute detective? There were times when the director couldn't be honest about whether Judas Kiss meant legitimate crime drama or barbaric spoofing. Why throw topless/alien/lesbian porn scenes for the first 2 minutes?

"First of all, I should point out that it was really fun to watch this documentary. Not only great music but also shooting and editing was great. However, all these positives about the film do not change the fact that bothered many of their Turkish people to the Asian ""Meet the East and the West"" cliché. All right, the film tells a traditional and modern Turkish music story in a very sophisticated way, showing that Europeans and Americans are not killing Armenians and Kurds to ignorant Europeans and Americans. However, the problem with the film is seeing the film defined as ""east"" in the ""west"" eye. As one jazz musician says in the film, there may be no east and west, perhaps a myth, and the fear created by the rulers of the ""Western"" state is to keep fear and hostility alive.

"STMD! It's not a terrible movie, but it's an unforgettable movie. Lighting is intentionally poor in many scenes, and unintentionally poor in the rest of the scene, so you may have a headache or poor vision. Special effects are imaginative but clear.

"First off, I have no idea how this movie made it to the big screen.Its not even the low budget SCI-Fi channel movie, its just awful.Me and my friend who love action movies, Independence day, Jurassic Park, LotR, etc. went to see this movie expecting this movie to me a Transformers with dragons, mindless entertainment.All we got was a mindless hour and a half.The CG was not as bad as I was expecting, but the plot is so awful along with Its basically a Chinese legged of dragons returning every 500 years...Sounds like a good remake of Rain of Fire?

"Recently, Steven Segal's film wasn't great, but it's the worst since the Patriots. The plot has so far been meaningless. It is not clear who the relationships between the characters are, who works for whom, or who doubles. The movie is completely separate, and each scene seems to make the story more confusing, not advancing the story. Even action sequences are difficult to follow without being inspired. Because you didn't understand the basics of filmmaking, most of the responsibility lies at the feet of the director, but Seagal, one of the filmmakers, should not leave lightly. Oh, and even according to Seagal standards, I didn't mention how terrible the smoke is. Like the video feed, Seagal fans are not worth seeing. Anchor wide!","Steven Seagal's recent movie wasn't accurate, but this is the worst since the Patriot. The plot has so far made no sense. It is not clear what the relationships between the characters are, who works for whom, and who double-crosses with whom.

Most of the responsibility needs to be at the foot of the director, because I can't even understand the basics of making a film, but Seagal, one of the producers of this film, also needs to share responsibility. Oh, and I don't even mention Seagal's standards, or how bad the acting is. As with the video prey, this isn't worth a look for Seagal fans. Wide berth!"
"I think it is a good thing. The original was my favorite RR movie, but it wasn't Rosalyn Russell fans. But I love Bethe and I am very happy that she is making this. <br /> <br /> I think the rest of the rest of the production is a bit smaller than the original movie. One of my favorite little characters in the original was Mazeppa, which sounded like a fingernail scratching the blackboard. ""HEY! To be a stripper, you have no talent!"" I missed it, but I was happy to see the producers have the courage not to carbon copy. <br /> <br /> Also, many parts of this movie feel as if they are in a theater, rather than a movie. <br /> <br /> Another thing I like about this piece seemed to be a little less repetitive, and the song ""Let me entertain you"" became completely annoying after hearing about five times.","I think it's good.

"A friend borrowed this DVD from the director at the festival. I warned that some of the technical aspects of the film were a bit shaky and the writing was good but not good.

Ernie Jones (also director) and Justin Lane were great as roommates that pissed Ernie off. Bill Lane, who spent many movies dressed as a panda, was my favorite.

Some of the other acting was good and some were too good, but none of them was bad. I also really liked the vigilante duo.

"The biggest period of cinema was Italy's neo-real movement, which began in postwar Europe. For the next two to thirty years, New Waver in France attracted everyone's attention, and always had Bergman on the deserted island of Scandinavia, creating bitter masterpieces. In 1971, however, Luchino Visconti introduced the work of art geographically through the miraculous work ""Death of Europoean Cinema""*. After the 60's, great filmmakers in Europe were also completely exhausted with the exception, delivering the torches to the new American film captains (Coppola, Scorsese, & Co.). This film is a great feeling for Visconti's special obsession, as well as the general attempts of European filmmakers to achieve aesthetic ideals in the film. And rest assured, there is no more work master than Visconti released here. He is not playing to the crowd. You chase him, follow him or lag behind. It's slow, but it's never a challenge without emotional weight. There are not many ""accidents"", but each seems to be full of symbolic meaning in the wrong universe. <br /> <br /> With regard to movies, we will never be in such a rare company again. Gustav Mahler's, one of the greatest actors of Gustav Mahler's main role (Visconti), one of the greatest writers of the century who inspired the story of Visconti, one of the best filmmakers who directed the film. Symphony No. 5 Visconti took full advantage of Mahler's ability to evoke romanticism even on the most cynical heart, turning the protagonist Aschenbach into an original persona composer of the original author, and even turning Bogarde into a LOOK like Mahler (geeky mustache, specs) Shaggy (head, duck-like walk), but Bogarde offers the greatest performance of the actor in the history of the film, it is almost a quiet performance and the actor needs to convey a gesture or a speaker of meaning at a glance Chaplin or simply an animated body Act like <br /> <br /> Cinema doesn't get any better than this, I'll ignore the complaints of Ritlin addicts who say it's too slow, but even the more legitimate grip on backfire with Aschenbach's hostile friend is misplaced. Flashbacks fit the movie's topical interests (ie, a better path to aesthetic completion:? passion or discipline), and the sudden and trembling of these interruptions serves to prevent drowsiness between viewers (of course some viewers anyway) You will sleep through this movie.) Killing the beautiful stream of Mahler and the beautiful and beautiful Venice is just a beautiful picture, but this movie is really about something, and the most important thing is pain. Romantic (Capital R) Pain. Visconti, a painful romanticist, knew where he said.<br /> <br /> [SPOILER... Nothing else. If so, open Venice's death *... And for an unforgettable ending, Bogarde's jet black hair dye has fallen from sweaty and dying hair to a white chalk face. Meanwhile, the young Tajio, the object of Bogard's desire from afar, stands in the sea and heads towards the horizon like a piece of Michelangelo. The climatic order is summed up with an economy that plagues everything about movies like love, lust, beauty, loss, the ending of life at the beginning of another life, and cold death in a warm, sunny beauty. * The death of Venice * is a miracle work of art. <br /> <br /> [DVD Tip: As with the Visconti masterpiece that was released at the same time, *Curse*: It's a good idea to turn on English subtitles while watching this movie Superficially English. DVD, but the sound of the DVD looks blurry, and anyway, many Italian movies","The greatest era of cinema began with the Italian neorealist movement in postwar Europe. For the next 20-30 years, the French New Wavers drew everyone's attention, and Bergman was always somewhere on the desolate Scandinavian island, making a bitter masterpiece. However, in 1971, Lucino Visconti spread the geographical form of the death of Venice* geographically. After the end of the 60's, with a few exceptions, the great European filmmakers who were generally exhausted and passed the torch to the new generation of American films Bratz (Coppola, Scorsese, and Co.). Did so too. The film feels like a summary of Visconti's particular obsession, as well as the general attempts by European filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal of the film. And rest assured. No more Sterner Taskmasters than the Visconti revealed here. He isn't playing towards the crowd, folks: you go behind him and follow, or you are left behind. Pace is a challenge. Slow, but not without emotional weight. There are few ""incidents,"" but each seems to be full of symbolic meaning in Sturm and Dolan Cosmos. One of the greatest writers of the century that inspired the story (Thomasman), one of the best filmmakers who directed it (Visconti), one of the best actors of the leading role (Dirk Bogarde), background. Gustav Mahler 5th Symphony, almost constantly swollen in. Making the most of Mahler's ability to stimulate romanticism even in the most cynical breasts, Visconti transforms the protagonist Aschenbach from his original persona as a writer into an obsolete composer, turning Bogard into Mahler. (Geek mustache, specs, hairy hair, duck-like walks). By the way, Bogard offers perhaps the best performance of the actor in the history of the movie: this is an almost silent performance, and the actor has to provide a sequence of meanings at a gesture or glance-like Act like a difficult trick Chaplin without robbery or just an animated corpse. <br /> <br /> Cinema can't get any better than this. Ignore the complaints from Ritalin addicts who say it's too late, but the more legitimate complaints about some of Aschenbach's flashbacks with their hostile friends are irrelevant. Flashback fits well into the concerns of the movie's subject (ie, a better path to aesthetic perfection: passion or discipline?), and the sudden and sharpness of these interruptions helps prevent viewers from drowsiness. (Of course, some viewers just watch this movie anyway.) The beautiful, dying Venice of Mahler's unstoppable flow is just a pretty picture. But this movie is really about something. And most importantly it is suffering: especially romantic (capital R) suffering. Visconti knew his story as a romantic he suffered. <br /> <br /> [SPOILER. .. .. Guess] If nothing else, see *Death of Venice* for its fascinating opening credits. .. .. And because of its unforgettable ending, Bogarde's jet-black hair dye drips from his sweating and dying head onto his chalky white face. On the other hand, in the distance, a young Tagio, the object of Bogarde's dying desire, stands at the sea and heads towards the horizon, like the Michelangelo sculpture. The sequence of climates is all summarized in the movie as a painful economy: love, desire, beauty, loss, end of life to the beginning of another life, and cold death in warm and sunny beauty. *Venetian Death* is a miracle work of art. <br /> <br /> [DVD Tip: As with Visconti's masterpiece *The Damned*, which was released at the same time, I recommend turning on English subtitles while watching this movie. Although superficially English, the sound of the DVD is muddy and a lot of Italian is spoken in the film. ] <br /> <br />"
"This is a stereotype plot. The young fighter is ready to take part in the competition when he is not ready and is not chosen to represent the battle school. This separates him from the fighting school and naturally finds a strange new owner who teaches fighting. <br /> <br /> The fight is not high. They are so simple in a way that 1 + 1 is simple for all adults. The fighter trains and enters the ring, but kicks without training. The coach does this without doing success. And after this ridiculous beating, he suddenly behaved as they were and hit his opponent once. Although our hero is beating his life up to that point, this marks a turning point in the fight. Think about the Rocky movie and you'll have a good standard of how much he actually plays. The fight did not go well. <br /> <br /> The last thing to ruin this movie is a silly romance.

"This production was really amazing for me. I am fond of movies from the early 30s, but I am not ready for the last 25 minutes of this story. If you are not sure in the first half, run there for the finale. Of course, you should consider shameless racism as purely local. It's a fascinating viewing experience, but I don't think CAT'S PAW is available for video/DVD. See the PBS list!","This work was quite surprising to me.

"It's not too bad, but ultimately it lacks the quality of the Australian series. <br /> <br /> Little jokes and actors are attractive (shouldn't be), if you think too much about filmmaker filmmaking (looks like home video), it's like a serious version of Kath and Kim... <br /> /> <br /> Kat and Kim are so normal. Kath and Kim should be two attractive middle-aged women in hot and funny clothes. ""Look at me, Kimi!"" joke. Kim's fat friend is not fat at all and is a bit silly. She is a rut black/latino chick. <br /> <br /> Not as silly or fun as the Australian series. Doesn't compare. There is no such thing. I admit that this show is sometimes fun, but not like the Australian series. I was looking forward to the Americans bringing my family. They failed.

"In the decline of the already oversaturated'Hillybilly Horror' sub-genre, this scary story about a holiday family feared by inbreeding. Sound familiar? Well, it should be the most obvious to anyone, even the obvious knowledge of the horror genre. There is something completely new here. The movie seems to recycle all of the old worn-out clichés (deformed chicks, killer shooters when peaceful families are forced, rebellious daughters, nice'bizarre people', etc.) but this is a total waste of time It should be about half as much as it is made. This is an unforgettable wreckage, but, humorously, Reed JD Hart starred in a movie called ""Smoking"" early in his career, which is a pretty ironic sign. <br /> <br /> My grade :D-","From the dilapidated class of the already saturated ""Hilibilly Horror"" sub-genre, this tragic story of a vacationing family dreaded by inbred redneckers emerges. Are you familiar with it? Well it should definitely be for anyone with a rough knowledge of horror genres. There is something new here. The movie looks happy to play back all the old-fashioned clichés that have been worn down (transformed Hick, a peaceful family became a gunshot murderer, a rebellious daughter, a heart) One enthusiastic ""Weirdo""...), but nevertheless enough heartfelt to completely waste this time. This is an unforgettable dreck, but the humorously-leading J.D. Hart once appeared in a movie called The Suck Suck early in his career. It's a very ironic omen. <br /> <br /> My score: D-"

I can't understand what would happen if I was performing in the way I acted in a movie that would be fired at work and owning the company. God! This movie was a plain, crushed and smelly POO pile. It's silly to have to comment on the 10 lines of text in the comments. What's wrong with just a few stories about the movie? I sometimes have a short novel on the site if a simple opinion is needed",stupid! stupid! stupid! I can't stand Ben anymore. How this guy is allowed to make movies is beyond me.

What's wrong with just saying a few things about the movie? I can't understand why a site needs a short novel when a simple comment is enough.
"This show is great for many reasons. Father and mother can talk to children at this age. It is better to look at the real family instead of the overcrowded family. I saw this once and got into trouble. The show left too quickly, but when it came out it covered pregnancy, sexy, drugs, bad dating, death, and more. Great show for the family.. I see this show until late at night and sometimes I can't tell you how many times with my head smiling. Excellent PG 13 star show. I liked everything on this show.","This show is great for many reasons. Fathers and mothers can communicate with children of this age. It's great to see a real family instead of a choking family.

Great show for the family.. I don't know how many times I've seen this show late at night and made my head laugh. Great 13-page rated show. I loved everything in this show."
"This movie is where the Batman franchise should stop. The idea of ​​“Batman Forever” was good and I would admit that a competent director could easily realize it, but it turned out that this was not the case. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers executives were disappointed by how dark Tim Burton's second Batman movie would be. In addition to the tolerance of expecting something different from Burton and the conservative coward of the subsequent decision to turn the franchise into a homage to the Sixties TV series, I don't understand how ""Batman Returns"" can be considered at all frustrating. <br /> <br /> Indeed, it's not quite the same as the first movie, fixing all the small flaws in the style found in ""Batman"", but a weak script that breaks the antagonism between three characters rather than two characters is uncertain. Call it. A great pair comparison of Keaton and Jack Nicholson as a joker in the first movie. But for all this, it remains a splendidly dark film in a way that Batman always intended and a satisfying way. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton returns to Batman and his self, Bruce Wayne. Nouveau riche tycoon Max Schreck (Christopher Walken, nominated for a lush German actor in the 1920s), his partner Oswald Cobblepot, a penguin (Danny DeVito with gorgeous makeup reminiscent of Laurence Olivier's ""Richard III""), Selina Kyle Wayne Is a catwoman (Michel Pfeiffer) dating both Batman and Batman. The four principals, especially Walken and DeVito, perform well, and Keaton and Pfeiffer together explore the dark side of dual identity. <br /> <br /> This movie has an interesting concept. The only weakness I can actually point out is the specific weakness of the script in some places. This movie mainly thinks this movie is a four-seater fighting way. There is not enough time to properly navigate the current work in progress. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this is a good movie. I saw this with the first and then how good the series continued in Burton and Keaton.","This movie is where the Batman franchise should have stopped. The idea behind Batman Forever is great and it turns out it wasn't, so I admit it could have been easily accomplished by a talented director, <br /> <br /> Obviously Warner Bros. Executives were disappointed with how dark Tim Burton's second Batman movie was. Except for the absurdity of expecting something from Burton and the conservative cowardice of the subsequent decision to turn the franchise into a homage to the 60's television series, I wonder how ""Batman Returns"" I can't understand what you think. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's not exactly the same as in the first movie-it repairs all the minor flaws in the style found in'Batman', but the hostilities of not only two but three. Weak scripts that split into characters make it look bad. Comparison of Keaton and Jack Nicholson's stunning pair as the Joker in the first movie. Yet, it remains true to Batman's true-life form and remains a gorgeous dark movie that is very satisfying. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton returns with Batman and his other ego Bruce Wayne tangled. Nouveau Rich Tycoon Max Shrek (Christopher Walken, named after the German silent actor of the 1920s), criminal Oswald Cobblepot, penguin (Danny Devito with a brilliant make-up reminiscent of Lawrence Olivier's ""Richard III""), And Serena Kyle, Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), Wayne romance both herself and Batman. While four principals, especially Walken and DeVit, perform great, Keaton and Pfeiffer are both exploring the dark side of a dual identity. <br /> <br /> This movie has some interesting concepts. For the only weakness I can really point out, I think the particular weakness of the script in some places is largely due to the way this film is a four corner battle. We just don't have enough time to properly investigate what is happening. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this is a damn good movie. I highly recommend watching this alongside the first and then crying about how good the series could be if it were continued under Burton and Keaton."
"The Quick and the Undead is the first movie to finally invalidate its own story line. It is essentially a huge pubic hole. <br /> <br /> Beyond that, the acting was pretty bad, the character motives didn't exist or were unbelievable, and there was no single character worth capping. The most exciting cast members (having great potential to become black horse protagonists) interrupted half of the process. <br /> <br /> Fast and undead is a great example of how to do this line of color timing. It looked great when considering budget considerations. <br /> <br /> Sadly, when a man held a hundred grand hands and saw a few Westerners (mostly Good, Bad and The Ugly) and accidentally threw a lot of elements into the movie... There is a movie with a character here! Is that right? No, but who is interested! Here it is!""<br /> <br /> For a very thriving cinematographer and colorist (first grade film cooler) It would be a good view. Otherwise, it must be missed.","Finally, Quick and the Undead is the first movie to actually turn off its own storyline. It is essentially one huge plot hall. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the acting was so bad that there was no character motivation, or it was incredible, and no character was worth wearing a hat. The most interesting cast members, who are very likely to become the protagonists of Dark Horse, were shrugged during the procedure. <br /> <br /> The quick and undead feature is a great example of a great way. Color timing. It looks great, considering the budget. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it looks like the guy got 100 Grands and saw some Westerns (especially Good, Bad, The).

"I was amazed at this movie. After that, I didn't want to watch any movies for a long time. If you compare any other movie, you won't be satisfied. <br /> <br /> For many people, it can be Antonioni's worst. Charming existing story lines, microscopic examination of human emotions and interactions, Wenders' worst verbose confusion transcendence. It consists of short and distinct episodes linked to the conscious flow of the typical winding heroes of the Wenders, so it does not temporarily cause an evasion of the fleeing cinema. Separated story lines sketch a poetic image that unfolds across the film. Wanderers and Antonioni create a discourse between the parts of finding the core of things. <br /> <br />","I was amazed by this movie. After that, I didn't want to watch any movies for a long time.

"I am the only one who thinks that the entire crime scene and crime scene in the United States should blame this omnipotent cheek on his face. The rookie police initially sent the child to the local shop to find the body because her backup reacted too slowly at the crime scene.

Fear continues:-Rincoln Rhyme character played by the President of Washington, not the movie itself (which is really plain). This man, instead of a highly trained but invisible local crime scene inspector, entrusts work to untrained and rookie police to find very obvious clues and move them before taking pictures to contaminate everything and make DNA profiling almost impossible. Was it a bright idea now? I know I need to be able to stop disbelief to some extent, but those who say that this film is intelligent have to release their thinking skills completely to find something that this film is reliable. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 4 Denzel Washington's great acting and Jolly's lips are the only items that stop my disbelief, 10/10!","Is I the only one who thinks American forensics and the entire crime scene have to dislike this all-around slap in their face?

"This is the second hitchcock movie on the list and the second hitchcock movie I've seen. The first one was a rope. It was really fun.

It looks like an average movie that could have been more. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock Relax among his serious people like this movie. As a thriller, I don't think I can actually get to my place or get engaged with a major figure who is traveling around the United States. The climax of the movie actually seems to have missed the opportunity to relax. There is very little sound design. You can hear the conversation and the surroundings, but the important thing is missing, the sweat is torn off the sleeves, and the music is needed to relax. There is no doubt intentionally, but there is no emotional punch you want in such a scene. Then suddenly the interior is empty. <br /> <br /> This movie feels like you can play around the world, but it's more limited. The script itself is very plain and seems to be looking for a more ambiguous way to make the plot move. <br /> <br /> There is a performance, but nothing surprising. Everyone plays his role in script words on the page. The relationship between the two leads was weak and more work was required. One thing that stands out is Otto Kruger. I know it is one of Hitchcock's most exciting movies, but I had a good time watching it. Not enthusiastically recommended.","This is the second Hitchcock movie on the list, and the second Hitchcock movie I've seen completely. At first it was the rope that I really enjoyed.

"It is always difficult to bring a 450 pages book down to a three hours film.I read the book before, and I found the BBC production dealing with this difficulty in the best way possible.The qualities of the book haven't been lost: the dense and lively depiction of a fingersmith patchwork family in London in the 1860s, the cold and obscene cruelty in which Maud is brought up, the characterization of different social groups by different ways of speaking, the unexpected and surprising twists of the story, the way the film makes the spectators look different at the same scenes when they are told first from Sue's point of view then from Maud's one. The main actors do very good, and especially the growing love between the two women is convincingly developed, with a first culmination in a very tender love scene between the two and finally forgiving all the evil they were ready to do and did to each other, because they still love each other.<br /><br /> For each of her books the author, Sarah While in Tipping the Velvet it was the world of the vaudeville theaters and the beginning of social movements, in Affinity the dreadful reality of women penitentiaries and the fashionable evocation of spirits, in Waters, has thoroughly investigated what life was like in British 19th century. Fingersmith she depicts the public ceremony of hanging people in London and the inhuman treatment of persons supposed or declared disturbed in asylums based on the reading of sources and scientific research.This is very well transferred to the film so that the corresponding scenes show a high grade of historic truth.I highly recommend this film production because it offers three hours of colorful Victorian atmosphere, vivid emotions, and suspense.","Making a 450-page book into a three-hour movie is always difficult.

"First, he said he was a ghost believer and knew that he actually existed. I have had enough experience to know that they are there. <br /> <br /> What I hate is those who bring all this into the Bible and religion. People forget that there are more than one ""Bible"", thousands of religions and beliefs, and many ways to interpret what is said in the Bible. Not everyone believes in God, and not everyone believes in the stereotypical religion. <br /> <br /> Religion does not make everything true. One of the things that many people do not know in the Bible is that some of the most magnificent Bibles even violate the rules written therein. You shouldn't wear more than one fabric at a time, slavery is normal, and in certain situations you can even kill your neighbors. None of this said, ""Oh, it was the Old Testament and now we have the New Testament."" The Bible is the word of God and cannot be changed. There should be no changes or versions. Religion is full of facts mixed with misunderstandings, and those who blindly follow it. ""There is no other way."" The excuses used by these blind followers are pathetic or inconsistent, and instead use excuses from pastors or teachers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, to a review. I am a great fan of ""Ghost Hunters"" and when I heard that this show is coming soon I was very excited and thought it was a bit of a possibility. As much as watching ""Ghost Hunters"", I don't like some of their members, and I don't like how they can dismiss the bullied place, but I can't explain what's going on. Just because the investigative equipment does not pick up the equipment does not mean that the camera shooting the show is not. I'm glad they're skeptical, but it's like you don't understand if the movie doesn't make the place a ghost because you get nothing on your recorder. If the ghost was captured so easily, it would be known as fact, not faith. It's close to ""the right place at the right time"" and if there is something in it, what do you think ""will perform"" for you? This show is silly. It is usually boring, there is a lot of conversation, a lot of hearing, but it rarely happens. The filtered narration of the main person is usually boring or basically unnecessary to listen to. <br /> <br /> Also, because I think there are very few gifted people in reality, I have too much dependence on psychology. Silvia Brown is definitely my belief, but most are hard to believe. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this show, but I'm still very impressed by the few.","First of all, I am a ghost believer, and I know that ghosts actually exist.

I'm a decent fan of the'Ghost Hunters' and when I heard this show start shortly, I was pretty excited and thought it had some potential.

I'm glad they're skeptical, but I don't seem to understand if the movie haunts the place just because you didn't have anything in the recorder. When a ghost can be captured so easily, it is known as a belief, not a fact. It's something like ""in the right place at the right time"" and why do you think it ""does"" for you, even if something is there? This show is a bit silly. It's usually boring, with lots of stories, lots of supernatural powers, but almost nothing happens. The protagonist's filtered narration is usually tedious to hear or basically not needed. <br /> <br /> Also, since very few people are really talented, we rely too much on psychic powers. Silvia Brown definitely believes, but in most cases it's hard to believe. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this show, but I've never seen it so much."
"'The Menagerie' has been my favorite'Star Trek' episode for a long time. Formulated by'City on the Edge of Forever' in recent years. What I liked about Mena Gary was that it was a harder star start with a fascinating backstory to the Trek storyline of the time. I think Gene Roddenberry's way of integrating the original pilot into two parts is still original. The'new' part of the story is an excuse for Kirk and a few others (and us) to see the pilot, but the idea that Spock is a legal armament is clever. If desired, you can drill holes in the plot. For example, given the Taloxian's mind control abilities and Captain Pike's condition, why should Pike be physically brought back to Earth? And there are other confusing questions about Pike and Komodo Mendez... It's best to enjoy ST's only two partners without thinking too hard about the details.","For a long time ""The Menagerie"" was my favorite ""Star Trek"" episode, but in recent years it has been influenced by ""City on the Edge of Forever"".

Still, I think the way Gene Roddenberry incorporated the original pilot into a two-part episode is pretty original. The ""new"" part of the story is largely an excuse to see Kirk and a few other people (and us) see the pilot, but the idea that Spock can go to court is wise.

"Writer and director Paul Chart's Coen Brothers-wannabe relies too much on ideas from other (better) films, but creates a gruesome atmosphere that keeps watching once. Robert Forster became loose as before running a psychotic psychiatrist (ha ha) who kills in the desert.

"Sensation took place when the movie was released. I was thrilled to see it. The beautiful, generally young, naked women were shot in an advanced style that we are familiar with in Hamilton's photographs. His photos never become porn, and so is this movie.

There is no real story, and the character remains a beautiful, beautifully photographed body, but not a real creature with a soul. Nothing really happens.

"If you've read Mother Night and enjoyed it so much (as I did) that you just have to see the movie, understand that you have to understand a fundamental element of Vonngut's writing-that beyond his story lies Vonnegut himself, and that you Can't put a human mind on the screen.Hi whit and humor just cannot be transcribed by a screenplay or even the best acting performance.I believe that this movie exceeds in asking the key questions that Vonnegut poses in his book, but those frequent . cynical moments of satire found on the page are not found on the screen.Does this mean that the movie misses the mark? Of course not. In my opinion, the movie succeeds because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book (It succeeds because it takes the fundamental elements of a story created by one of America's true artistic treasures and presents it in aa framework without pretense.I 've seen other movie versions.This is not a medium for those too lazy to turn a page). of Vonnegut books where the director obviously tries to channel Vonnegut's genius and loses grip on his own craft.I would not place this movie as one of the best I've seen, but it stands on its own legs as one well worth watching.By taking Vonnegut's ""voice"" out of the movie's narration or trying to insert it however it can, Mother Night tells his story brilliantly, and preserves the story's fundamental lessons without confusion, distraction, or disappointment.","If you read Mother Nights and enjoyed it so much (as I did), understand that you only have to watch the movie.

"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

And they were quite confused that they always touched each other's genitals. But the most ridiculous is an inexpensive attempt to appeal to the film to mention German history and show the sensitive side of ""heroes"".

"Many contributors have noted the age difference between Stewart and Novak. When the film was released, she was 25 and 50 years old. The difference isn't important for a tense drama like Vertigo, but it's important for a romantic comedy. We can easily understand why his character is attracted to her, but it is not clear why she will be attracted to her. The scene of her staring at him across the cat's head, her dark eyebrows burning and buzzing, and the cat's beating are real magic.

Wow, I was really looking forward to it. But I wasn't prepared for how electric it was. Prince's musical performances throughout the film are not surprising. He really has a move on this.

"Yes, this is one of the THOSE movies, I can't laugh because it's so horrible, so stupid, so scary. I saw a comedy, a good comedy, laughed less than my wife and laughed in this movie.

Oh acting -. We talk about tired conversations and embarrassing pauses.<br /> <br /> But rats, big rats. The reason we didn't see the rats until we were done surprised me. Because the budget is limited and the good effect chews too much money, it is often not visible until the'big thing' ends.

"The story follows right from the end of part 1, and in the second half we talk about a much more brutal aspect of the inevitable downfall and human heritage. In contrast to the first feature, the second part refers to the transition from pride and glory of the revolutionary state to sieve. Changing settings is not just aesthetic. The color of the forest and the color of the heart changed from the gray of the autumn and spring of the forest, replacing the predecessor's optimism with a cynical, assaulted and wounded reality that fit into a whole new struggle. But, as Che continues, it is best to call such a struggle the same. Part 1 helped document the first surge in revolutionary guerrillas gained for the first time, but Part 2 took a much more refined, apathetic and desolate part of Che's life and ambitions, and made a strong and tragic argument Depict. <br /> <br /> In a way, the tone of the movie is blurry and significantly different from Part One, but the same documented approach as it was a month ago to avoid melodrama still remains. And made as much as possible. A rather distant, cold approach to tell Che's story and struggle will undoubtedly turn off some viewers. In fact, I'm still holding on to whether the feature itself should have been named after a person. If the whole Che who took the whole documented a man's struggle with him instead of telling a story that goes beyond simple biographies, he helped him along the way. Soderbergh is not trying to paint here a humanistic portrait similar to what Hirschbiegel did with Der Untergang 30 years ago (don't forgive the ironic contrast). Che is a slow booked and contemplative approach that tells history lessons that are told by a single person who has done everything without controversy. <br /> <br /> Cuba's story of retreating from Bolivia's desolate and decaying background in part 2, escaping from the lush green landscape, inevitably takes a distinct contrasting tone, giving it a feeling that is not too tied to its predecessor. Only enough to provide your own reference point. Here, the basic structure of Part One is echoed. There are early struggles, battles, fallen comrades and recruiting people to replace them. However, as anyone with an ambiguous idea of ​​the actual history supporting this feature will know, Part Two is destined to end in a much more overwhelming and unpleasant language. This difference, combined with the similarity with Part One, makes an attractive and memorable whole. Anyway, you can both digest it yourself (you can be praised by Soderbergh for achieving it) and enjoy it as it is, but with one statement, Che conveys exactly what it is trying to achieve. <br /> <br / Indeed, everything that made Part One a month ago is still evident in subtle but engaging performances, from the central cast to slow buildings and realistically composed battle scenes. The character's own drama on the screen is only ambiguous and inconspicuous, but Part Two, equipped with features like this, once again avoids these elements, so there are enough intrigues and reflections on other elements to induce viewer participation. When it doesn't hurt the movie. In fact, when I wrote this review, I was wondering if I would just add one or two paragraphs to the first review of Part One and give the whole review a title. The disillusionment of people who can sit down to watch both movies in succession. <br /> <br /> With that said, I can't legitimately decide whether Che will keep the mission of drawing the crowd over 4 hours. It's runtime, but when you look at two segments you can at least prove the functionality of each part. Reflecting on endlessly fascinating photos and subtle performances, combined with endlessly fascinating photos and subtle performances without paying attention to the characters in the movie, Che Part Two is as charming and rewarding as its predecessor, but this time reaffirming the conclusions that fit the tragic but noble movie's history page . <br /> <br /> -Jamie Robert Ward's review (http://www.invocus.net)","That's exactly what the second half sets about telling the inevitable downfall and much more severe aspects of a man's heritage, starting directly from where the story ended in Part 1. In contrast to the first part, Part 2 represents the transformation of Choi, the pride and glory of a revolutionary nation, into a struggle in a previously unconnected nation. Changing settings is not just aesthetic. From gray and autumn in the forest to tone and heart in character, the optimism of the predecessor was replaced by a cynical and battered reality of reality in a whole new struggle. Still, such a struggle, as Choi calls himself, is the best struggle to be told exactly that way. Part 1 certainly helped document the first surge that the revolutionary guerrillas acquired through it, while Part 2 takes on the much more sophisticated cold and dark segment of Choi's life and ambitions. Portrays a pressing and tragic claim.<br /> <br /> The tones of the film deviate in some respects and are quite different from Part 1, but to avoid the soap opera. The same documented approach taken a month ago remains and as much production as possible. This rather distant approach to telling the story of Choi and the struggles will undoubtedly erase some viewers. Indeed, I'm still withheld whether the feature itself should have been named after a man. The person who helped him carry along the way. Soderbergh is by no means trying to portray a humanistic portrait here, as Hirschbiegel did in Der Untergang half a century ago (sorry, ironic contrasts). Choi is a slow-moving, unobtrusive, meditative approach that tells a history lesson that is happening to be spoken by a man who probably conducted everything. <br /> <br /> Still, the Cuban story of receding into Bolivia's dark, declining background for Part 2 by moving out of the lush landscape inevitably feels too disjointed from its predecessors. It does not have a clear contrast, but it is sufficient to give itself a reference point. Here we echo back the basic structure of Part 1. There are first struggles, fights, fallen comrades, and their adoption to replace them, during which we see some of the guys behind the movement. Still, as anyone who has a vague idea of ​​the actual history behind this feature knows, Part 2 is doomed to end up with a much more overwhelming and disturbing memo. This difference, combined with the similarities to Part 1, makes it an attractive and impressive whole. Either way, you can put both together (and praise Soderbergh for achieving it) and enjoy it as-is, but Che's as one statement is exactly what you've set out to achieve. Offers. <br /> <br />It's true that all of the treatment of Part 1 a month ago was a subtle yet immersive performance, from the central cast to the slow buildings to the realistic battle scenes. From here, too, it's clear. The drama specific to the characters on the screen is vague and indistinguishable, but Part 2 with features like this, if other factors have enough conspiracy and reflexes to keep the viewer's interest, It proves that avoiding such factors does not necessarily hurt the movie. In fact, when writing this review, I was dissatisfied with whether to add one or two paragraphs to the first review in Part 1 to title the entire review, but do so That disillusions the person sitting to watch the whole of both movies in succession. <br /> <br /> Still, I can't properly declare whether Choi will continue to work to attract that large four-hour audience. At runtime, displaying both segments at least proves that each part can do it. Combining reflective and complex screenplays, endlessly captivating photos, and subtle performances that bring justice to the movie's characters without getting noticed, Che Part Two is as compelling as its predecessor, It's rewarding, but this time it's tragic but uplifting. Double-check the conclusions that fit the movie history page. <br /> <br />-Review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)"

"I had never seen a film by John Cassavetes up until two years ago, when I first saw THE KILLING OF A Chinese BOOKIE in a Berlin cinema, which I found interesting, to put it diplomatically, but not so special, I instantly wanted to see more of his work. Since then, I tried-with an emphasis on tried-watching his other work, SHADOWS in particular.I must admit, it took me aa while before I actually enjoyed the film.At first the unpolished, raw and improvised way Cassavetes it was shot , put me off somewhat and I thought of it as an original-absolutely-but flawed and dated experiment. But now, upon reviewing, these little imperfections make it look so fresh, even today.<br />< br />Shot on a minimal budget of $40,000 with a skeleton six person crew, SHADOWS offers an observation of the tensions and lives of three siblings in an African-American family in which two of the three siblings, Ben (Ben Carruthers) and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni), are light-skinned and able to pass for white. Ca ssavetes demanded that the actors retain their real names to reflect the actual conflicts within the group but saw the film as being concerned with human problems as opposed imply to racial ones. Cassavetes shot the film in ten minute takes and jagged editing, a reaction against'seamless' Hollywood production values. Cassavetes main inspiration-at least in the cinematic style the film was shot-were the Italian neo-realists whilst also professing admiration for Welles' pioneering spirit. The use of amateurs and improvisation might resemble some of the Italian neo -realist directors, but with his bebop score by Charles Mingus ans Shafi Hadi, the film feels very different, very American, unlike anything made before really.<br /><br />The song with the feathered girls, ""I feel like a lolly-pop"" (or something) feels like light years back to me, ancient history. But no matter how dated it might look, it still makes a delightful time capsule of late Fifties New York today. I think it's t his is one of the first films made aspiring filmmakers realize they could shoot an independent film, without Hollywood, improvised and without a real budget.Seymour Cassel, who acted and was involved in SHADOWS, claims it was Jules Dassin's THE NAKED CITY (1948) that was the first and inspired them all, but I think this was the one that really opened the eyes of aspiring independent American filmmakers.<br /><br />Camera Obscura --- 8/10","I had never seen a movie by John Casavetes until two years ago.

Cassavetes shot the film with a 10 minute take and jagged edit. This is a reaction to the ""seamless"" Hollywood production value. Cassavetes' main inspiration-at least the style of the film in which the film was filmed-was an Italian neorealist, proclaiming praise for Wells' pioneering spirit.

But no matter how old it looks, it still becomes a fun time capsule of today's late 50s New York. I think this is one of the first films to make filmmakers aspiring to film an independent film improvisationally without Hollywood and without a real budget. Seymour Kassel, who played and was involved in Shadows, claims that Jules Dassin's THE NAKED CITY (1948) was the first and inspired all of them, which is an aspiring American independent filmmaker. I think that the eyes of the person are really open. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 8/10"

"SHALLOW GRAVE starts with a tribute or a start in PSYCHO's shower scene. (I'm looking forward to tearing) After that it gets worse and surprisingly more original.

You can't witness it, but you can run across the marijuana farm.) It's not a movie, it's the point where the story really comes close. Tony March doesn't have to practice his Oscar speech, but Sheriff Dean becomes a horrible facsimile of a normal person torn by what he has to do and do. Tom Law is a deputy Scott, a courteous and southern agent as seen from Walton Goggins (Deputy Director Steve Naish) at the home of 1000 CORPSES. <br /> <br /> Some scenes from the movie are worth it. Advert. Girls stop by a South Carolina BBQ to show racism when a big black man checks out. Suellen jumps into the barn, hiding behind hay bales, and in a surprisingly realistic moment, a large snake is hiding in the hay with her. <br /> <br /> And in the strangest scene, sheriff Dean instructs Carol Cadby to undress. Dean turned on the radio to silence the noise he was trying to do. The radio preacher must go back and read his Bible. His sermon is about how Jezebel is saved by the blood of Jesus Christ.

"This movie received a lot of acclaim, but I personally thought it was boring. There is a nice Brazilian sunset and the characters are reliable, but very unusual by our standards, but the story of how they are interrelated is not interesting enough to keep the movie for a long time. The women in the center are organized close to each other, putting children's interests first. As the tolerance of various people increases, you will see their character develop. The story unfolds gracefully and is helped by great acting. You can't get a glimpse of the area behind Brasilia, where the city is far away, but open your eyes.","The film received a lot of praise, but I personally found it boring.

Isn't interesting enough. Central women pick up men one after another in a close manner, putting children's interests first. We find that as the tolerance of various men expands, their personality develops. The story unfolds with dignity and is supported by excellent acting. Far from the city, a rare glimpse into Brazil's hinterland is rare, but never too exciting to keep an eye on."

"I know little or nothing about astronomy, but nevertheless;. I was a bit skeptical about the plot of the first A movie, it was born during a solar eclipse and I have no emotions (so naturally) I follow three children who have become ruthless serial killers. The plot is funny at first. Sounds like a sound, but once you know that a solar eclipse is blocking Saturn, Saturn is an emotional planet, and it all falls into place. I understand completely, and you're not seeing another silly 80s slasher with the pea brain plot. Thank God! But Bloody Birthday is based on a silly premise, but more than just complementing it with originality. Taking the slaughter of many children may not be the most original master stroke in the cinema, but when choosing one of the other dull choices this Friday and the 13th -. I know what I've chosen <br /> <br /> It's also a fact that it's very fun to help a movie in the hole where some people think they dig the movie. Many slashers are formulated so quickly that the audience simply sees Gore. However, the film continues with children's creepy performances (which go back to creepy children's classics like the villages of a village), a constant stream of humor, and a small but impressive film type. Dose of tension and tension. One of the things I liked in this movie was a massive amount of weapons. Not worse than a slasher where the murderer repeatedly uses the same weapon (cough cough for Halloween), but this doesn't apply as Bloody Birthday finds room for everything from skipping ropes to bows and arrows. There was no room for a chainsaw. It's a shame, but you can't put a chainsaw in every movie.","I know little or no astronomy, but nevertheless; I was a bit skeptical of the film's conspiracy at first. It all follows emotionally because it was born during an eclipse, so it follows (three) children who are (crudely) ruthless serial killer. The plot sounds ridiculous at first, but once you understand that eclipse blocks Saturn, you know, Saturn is the planet of emotions and everything falls in the right place. It makes perfect sense, and you'll find that we're not just looking at another stupid 80's slasher in a pea brain plot. Thank God! Seriously, however, Bloody Birthday is based on a silly premise, but it's more than a complement to it with originality. Having lots of kids around the massacre may not be the most ingenious masterstroke ever seen in the movie, but either this or another dull Friday's thirteenth clone. Selecting, I know what to choose. <br /> <br /> Also, helping the movie out of the hole that some would think of as a stupid plot that delved into it is the fact that it's very entertaining. Many slashers formalize too quickly, and the audience ends up looking only at the gusset. However, the film has a great spooky performance of the kids (think of it as a classic of spooky kids such as the Village of the Damned), a certain sick humor, and a small but impressing movie of this type. Performance continues. Suspense and tension dose. My favorite thing in this movie was the huge number of weapons. It's not worse than a slasher where a hitman uses the same weapon over and over again (a coughing Halloween cough), but not because Bloody Birthday finds all the room from a skipping rope to a bow and arrow here. There was no place for a chainsaw. This is very disappointing, but not all movies can include a chainsaw."
"A few years later, I saw this beautiful love story again. Half a century later, for my understanding, when I was a boy, many girls thought about how to respond to a movie that cried and sighed at the time. But the behavior of women in a small city in Brazil. <br /> <br /> What I noticed in this movie was something very different. In other words, it was a claim with a doctor, Dr. Suin (Jennifer Jones). To the journalist Mark Elliott (William Holden), we make clear the special ethical conditions of Eurasia. In fact, she continues to focus on this in her relationship, and is willing to accept her love for herself and to be willing to practice it ""in a Western way"", thereby betraying the Chinese side. The audience seems to be working hard to try very subtle coordination between the two facets of the unstable and opposing aspects of culture. Because they will immediately cause an apparent conflict in the mind with minimal failure to try to control. <br /> <br /> So Suyin's attitude remains desperate and embarrassed without knowing how important the poor Eliot, who is always decisive, brave and very practical, to her words. The situation is completely clear to him that the love for her is clear and simple. If we love each other, let's make a couple and start life together. ""It's not too fast"" is that she always answers verbally. <br /> <br /> The Chinese part of the sign will never allow her that level of pragmatism. And while she strengthens this aimed balance between these two worlds within herself, she often finds herself in the real world by the very unique features of Chinese culture, the invisible beings in the spiritual or non-physical world. Suyin always warns Elliott of how dangerous life is, not because of objective and specific threats (such as the perpetuation of English colonialism or Japanese aggression). But because of the many threats that are cruel and harmful, the gods of the poor, fearful and vulnerable, and mysterious and mythical beings. <br /> <br /> In fact, it seems that many Chinese gods are constantly watching to make people's lives completely miserable. For that reason, mothers should wear precious baby girls as girls' clothes, and not be taken away by jealous gods. Everyone must be prepared to make a loud noise to send the clouds away so as not to obscure the moon's view. Farmers are advised to shout out loud, ""Rice is bad, rice is bad!!"" To protect crops from being stolen by gods;. It is better not to use the sorrows and weaknesses of the gods by separating the family of the dead from the funeral with curtains. <br /> <br /> In other words, it introduces a culture in which supernatural beings exist, as the malevolent and sadistic pantheon of sadistic gods always negatively interferes with some of the most terrible behaviors in someone's daily life. <br /> <br / When the story took place in Hong Kong in 1949, it should be clear that China at that time was almost a semi-feudal society, and that the country Eliot came from was not yet dominated by fierce capitalism. After the first oil shock in 1973, he was in charge of the whole world launched by the United States. So, at least in one aspect, the two sides of Suin's Eurasian character are far more innocent than today. <br /> <br /> A lot of history has occurred since this era. When it comes to China, the main fact is that, after several stages of the communist regime, the state has reached a very aggressive state of the economy that has been much better portrayed as national capitalism over the past 20 years. And what happened to the old hospitality that impressed Elliott on the tree behind the hill and the hospital that insisted on so many people in Hong Kong in 1949? Completely gone! In short, if the story happened today, Elliot thought there was no need to go to China to suggest to Suin where the third uncle and her whole family were. In fact, the two are now close enough to be incomparable with each other, talking about business as usual through great pragmatism!","Years later, I saw this beautiful love story again. Half a century later, when I was an adolescent man trying to understand, I thought about how many girls would react to a movie that wept and sighed. Women's actions in a small city in Brazil. <br /> <br /> However, what drew my attention in the movie this time was a strong claim by doctor Dr. Han Swin (Jennifer Jones). Clarifies special ethical conditions as a Eurasian to journalist Marquette (William Holden). In fact, she has always focused on this relationship, accepting that she loves herself repeatedly, and willing to do it in an ""accidental way."" However, doing so will not betray the Chinese side. .. The audience seems to be working hard to establish a very delicate reconciliation between the insecure and conflicting two sides of their culture. <br /> <br /> Therefore, Syuin's attitude has always made poor Elliot (a determined, brave and very practical man) anxious and confused, and not knowing how important her words are Leave it alone. For him, whose love for her is obvious and simple, the situation is completely clear. If we love each other, make a couple and start life together right away. ""Not so fast"" is something that seems to always answer him, verbal and non-verbal. <br /> <br /> In fact, the Chinese part of Swin will never allow such a level of pragmatism. And as she continues to reinforce this highly purposeful balance between these two worlds within her, she also finds that the very unique character of Chinese culture is deeply rooted in her mind. Being, that is, the real world of invisible beings from the spiritual or non-physical world. Swin always warns Elliot how dangerous life is, not because of an objective and concrete threat (such as the perpetuation of British colonialism or the predominance of Japanese aggression). Because there are many cruel and harmful threats. Gods and other mysterious and mysterious beings cover poor, scary and vulnerable humans. <br /> <br /> In fact, it seems that the entire bunch of Chinese gods is forever monitored in order to make people's lives completely miserable. As a result, mothers must wear their precious male babies in girls' clothes so that they will not be robbed by a jealous god. Everyone should be ready to make loud noises and keep away from the clouds to avoid illuminating the moon. Farmers are encouraged to yell out ""Rice is bad! Rice is bad!"" To prevent their crops from being stolen by God. And at funerals, it is recommended that curtains separate the family of the dead from others to prevent the gods from harnessing their sadness and fragility. <br /> <br /> In other words, we introduce us to a culture where the Suin supernatural is real. It's as if the evil demons and the Pantheon of sadistic gods are on the verge of negatively interfering with the most mundane acts of everyday life. <br /> <br /> This story took place in Hong Kong in 1949, so the country in which Elliott was born was not yet dominated by such fierce capitalism, while China at that time was almost a semi-feudal society. It's clear that it was launched by the United States after the first oil shock in 1973 and was responsible for the whole world. So, in at least one aspect, both sides of the Eurasian character of Swin were far more innocent than they are today. <br /> <br /> Much history has been born since ancient times. Regarding China, the main fact is that, after some stages of the communist regime, the country has finally been described more appropriately as state capitalism in a very aggressive economic state in the last two decades. became. And what happened to the old spirituality that inspired Sing in Hong Kong in 1949, under the tree on the hill behind the hospital, and impressing a very ardent Elliot? It's gone, it's gone! Simply put, if that story happened today, Elliott would find that he didn't have to go to China to propose to Sing in front of his third uncle and her entire family. In fact, both men are now talking business as usual, in their immense pragmatism, approaching incomparably!"

"The movie, which is hard to imagine, is based on a true story, and the way Christy was able to accomplish a miracle is truly touching. Daniel Day-Lewis is a chameleon, and it's hard to imagine how much effort was put into making a disabled character. Seeing him on the screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience. <br /> <br /> The movie is not as pessimistic as I thought. The story is rather bright and interesting. Christy does not despise the top and his life is colorful and enjoyable. Even though we can see loneliness and painful commotion through his eyes. The unknown actress Brenda Fricker also deserves an Oscar for this role. Hugh O'Conor is also as prominent as the young Christy. Christy's love story is very good and reliable. Christy wants love and can't elicit the right to love anything. Curious about the beautiful Dr. Eileen Cole (played by the amazing Fiona Shaw.

It's really hard to imagine how much effort he made to create this impaired character. Seeing him on the screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience. <br /> <br /> Although the film isn't as pessimistic as I once thought, the story is a bit cheerful and intriguing. Christie is not overly disdainful. His life is also colorful and fun, but we can notice lonely and painful shackles through his eyes. It looks more touching, and unknown actress Brenda Flickr also deserves her Oscar award for this role, this fat little middle-aged woman takes her to fulfill Christie's dream. I will use everything. And very lucky for Christie! And Hugh O'Connor is great as a young Christie, what a great performance for a child! Christy's love story is very good and reliable. Christy seeks love and can't get the right to love him. He fell in love with the beautiful Dr. Eileen Cole (surprisingly played by Fiona Shaw), and I was deeply impressed with her role in the Harry Potter series, the dreadful aunt Petunia, and her appearance. This role is really beyond my heart, but anyway, the woman has her own youth...) Delusional and aggressive, I sympathize with him, love is a double-edged sword There is happiness and suffering just next to the others. <br /> <br /> By the way, all of Jim Sheridan's work (except in America, Boxers, etc.) except GET RICH OR DIE Trying', God knows why he decided to direct that crap. ! What a pity his career really is!"
"I was surprised that the reviewers @ IMDb gave this TV movie as high a rating as they did. It's a harmless, sweet, uncomplicated cliche of two big-named movies in the past (both did a decent job). However, this film affects the low-budget work we see all day. Less cable channels. I like good romance as well as others, but my wife and I have been watching this. And before we look at the rating, ""There are people who would rate this movie too high because we have nothing. We can make a good movie like challenging their brains, beliefs, comfort or cultural preferences (she's far away That's an example), this was amateur time, watch another movie <Family Stone> on the long line of a truly insufficient vacation movie.","I'm surprised that the reviewers @ IMDb gave this TV movie as high a rating as they did.

I like good romance and everyone, but my wife and I were watching this, so before looking at the ratings, I said, ""Someone overestimates this movie just because there is nothing in it.

"Search for titles on Randolph Scott. TRAIL STREET is the one movie you're missing from the list you've seen. One of the four films produced by RKO during Scott's Prime (1947), the other is always readily available. Liberal, Kansas, is a powder keg that explodes between trail riders that drive Longhorn into Trail Street, the town's Main Street, and the Sword Burst that feeds Belly, in the southwest of Dodge City. A strong man like Bat Masterson has to step between the two groups and order the village. I won't tell you any more, except that there is usually one pretty girl in the Scott movie and three girls in this movie. RANDOLPH SCOTT has always been able to find people who want to do the right thing with honor, courage, head and head. Fifty years ago, parents were able to send their children to Scott's film, convinced they would learn positive values ​​for them. In this movie, Robert Ryan, along with the stars, played a good man for change. In fact, Ryan was one of the many World War II Heroes that appeared in American movies. How sad we are to get these days. George Clooney teaches our young people that we need to sympathize with suicide bombers, and Steven Spielberg teaches that there is no moral difference between an Olympic athlete killed in Munich in 1972 and a Palestinian terrorist who was killed. Hollywood 2005 leads to a moral compass with too much cocaine and dedication to the wrong left. I'm curious how all this goes in Kansas liberalism. After all, liberalism was not a dirty word when it called the city 150 years ago.","Do a title search on Randolph Scott. TRAILSTREET is one of the movies that is missing from the list you have seen.

"I went to see this with a lot of expectations. Unfortunately, the conversation is completely folly and there is no fear or interest in the entire gypsum film. Even children can see the missing logic of the character's behavior. Children today need creative stories to inspire them. That's exactly what happened in movies like ET. And 10 years ago Star Wars.

"After the highlands of darkness, Holness and Adobye never thought they could make as good as half of the garth marengi. But I think it's a show (in a good episode) that is as good as a person to person in the dark. I can't claim that 2 of the episodes are actually not so good, but the other 4 definitely complement it. If I had to choose 2 great episodes, I would choose Formula 4 driver Steve Pising (pronounced phishing) and the great Garth Marengi. When Dean Learner makes a lot of inside jokes, having a little understanding of the program is a real advantage. His claim to Defrefort was against their name. A great show that missed the entire score because of a few episodes that weren't funny.","After the rise of darkness, it was by no means conceivable that Holness and Adbee could make something as good as half Garth Marengi. Still, I think one-on-one in itself is as good a show (with a good episode) as Dark Place. I can't say that two episodes are really good, but the other four episodes definitely make up for it. If I have to pick two great episodes, I go to Formula 4 driver Steve Pacing (pronounced Pissing) and the great Garth Marengi. Dean Learner makes a lot of internal jokes, so it's really a plus to understand the program a bit, but even if you haven't seen many Dean ids, some of the anger he launches is a genius. His discussion with Def Lepord about their name. All in All is a great show that missed the full mark because there are few funny episodes."
"I saw this movie in the theater while on vacation in Pablo. I quit my biomedical engineering work at the hospital.

"I found this on television and loved it when I was a kid. In the 1970s, it was surprising because there were many lame comedies that tried to be so fun. One of the best comedies of the 1970s and one of the decisive summer camp comedies thanks to Murrary's outstanding comedy performance. This is a film that Ivan Reitman actually noticed as a director. Reitman proves that he is one of the most talented comedy directors in this film. This movie is fun and MEATBALLS 2 is so bad that it's fun, but it is recommended for those who enjoy MEATBALLS 3 and MEATBALLS 4 STRIPES and GHOSTBUSTERS.","One day I caught this on TV.

"The design of the movie seems to be alpha and omega of some of the main issues in this country (USA). We see all relationships in a college setting for movies. Suitably there is a student-to-student clarity teacher. But what the film adds to its value is a different relationship: male vs. male. Female, white vs black and individual vs society. But most of all, it is the individual units that are most important and directly related to all other relationships. himself. <br /> <br /> The director was surprised at both sides' view of the racial relationship on campus. Most movies usually show unfairness on one side and pain on the other. The film showed both injustice and pain. I said the skin hair was much more cruel and devoted (clear to the end of both), but I didn't try to show which one was right. The movie also talks about sex and rape. In some ways, it is ironic that it is ironic that two races come together for a while. Lawrence Fishburne is a magnificent professor Phipps, and performs best. He breaks down on the idea of ​​racial favor and instead shows lazy, positive and lazy parallels. Other stars that make this film are Omar Epps, Ice Cube, and Jennifer Connelly. Michael Rapaport well portrays confused young people with misplaced anger seeking acceptance. Tyra Banks makes a movie debut and proves that supermodels can act. <br /> <br /> High learning earned a reputation for showing college rather than going to class and getting a piece of paper. In fact, I would say that the film is a real education in college, more like a satire showing interaction with students than a dry book. It is a process of learning life, not text learning. I think ""higher learning"" is an important problem for many colleges and a suggestion for general life. 8/10","The design of the film is like Alpha and Omega for some of the major issues in this country (US).

"Is rich, ailing Elizabeth Taylor courting the Angel of Death on her island fortress in the Mediterranean, or is she just overreacting--or more precisely, overacting--as usual?

"Each movie is the worst part of this movie as it is hidden from one premise to the next, missing all the important parts that made possible several different stories. (This movie is confusing because the audience doesn't know what the story is.) I had a problem with the production value being low and the acting was not great, but it was fine. It doesn't matter if some scenes seem to have been done at once. However, having such a pointless scenario is completely unnecessary. Have you ever read an officer before actually withdrawing cash? Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br /> The prologue was particularly miswritten, so I needed a speech commentary to fill out all the omitted details. Prologue was in a hurry, and it wasn't clear what was going on. The Russian Revolution was reduced to ""some riots are taking place in St. Petersburg,"" and the next scene captured soldiers.

Love's attention seems like a crazy maniac bursting out with a fervent gesture. The film doesn't work because it eventually decides to tell the truth of the monologue. They were never married and she returned to the United States. The love story collapses. Despite the many love scenes, I was never sure why they were in love. Romcom finds a more convincing romance despite having only one or two scenes. <br /> <br /> Where thriller-style things happened, the film assumes who it is and tries to prove its identity. no. Court cases are summarized rather than addressed. A bizarre voice comes out again to fill in the details of a better movie. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing to consider is what actually happened. Anna Anderson went to the United States, was Loony who married another Loony, and they did something crazy together. She spent the life of a maniac all her life. Neither of these in movies. There is a really annoying character in exile, growing up everywhere and announcing herself as a'Cookie's Next / '12 Monkeys' type informant, thankfully she disappeared and brought nothing to the story.","The script is the worst part of the film, lurking from one premise to the next, lacking all the important elements that would have enabled many different stories.

"Wow, what's on the shelf in the video rental store in front of me? There is nothing but a suspicious ""sequel"" to 8MM.

Even the DVD's menu screen is just a movie with a naked woman to make the DVD look completely provocative. <br /> <br /> David wasn't a hero in the whole movie. You can guess that it was a major problem long before he became the last. The actors in each role were all new to me, and I can explain how many people were deprived to get their ""respect"" behavior. There was a conspiracy hole (how did David and Richard finally impress Tish's father by signing the lease he wanted when David was caught up in this fucking investigation to find a prostitute?) like the bondage queen like a ridiculous email program), and Gay brother character shows how the director tried to knock out Joaquin Phoenix to play this character.

"Okay, honestly, I don't know why everyone thinks this is so great. Not really. There were two good things about this movie. 1. Jack's performance, he was so good that he could wear a hat. 2. Danny's performance was good. Then I became quite an idiot. And what did Stanley Kubrick think of writing Shelly in Wendy? She was too bad. Whenever she was afraid, she looked the same. The problem with this movie was the ending. If Kubrick had done it differently, it would have been more respected. And, all the movies were silly.

In addition, given the fact that the woman committed suicide in the room, wouldn't she take some precautionary measures before entering? Maybe she could investigate during the day, or maybe she was someone. And you can investigate the apartment, or maybe she can turn on the lights!!! Also, while in the haunted house she decides to call the operator many times and hangs up Discuss who has the authority to do and they will start talking about the details of suicide. Just unplug the phone! No need to be involved by the telephone company. Approach the phone and unplug it. Case closed <br /> <br /> Finally, it was just a comical to cross the floor alive and show the phone scammers: if the director was squeezed by a woman to a telephone card Could have done it in a way that doesn't look like Brave Little Toaster?"

"A movie for a mature and educated audience... <br /> <br /> Just before the North American release, I saw ""Random Heart"" in a pre-screening. This romantic drama was great.

It's a very different type of movie with a perfect complex role that makes the screen elegant in next year. Harrison Ford next year directed by Robert Zemeckis (""Forrest Gump"", ""Back to the Future"") in the summer 2000 thriller ""What's Lying?"" ""), and Clancy's ""sum of all fears""'Tom' in Tom's film adaptation later this year will be Harrison Ford's third excursion to CIA agent Jack Ryan.<br /> <br /> Director Sydney Pollock (""Outside Africa"", ""Company"", ""Tutty"") is a political advisor to Congressman Scott -Thomas in this feature, a very sharp and lively portrayal to Pollack. Sydney Pollack is a talented Not only a director, but one of the most reliable, natural and attractive actors around (see ""Eyes Wide Shut"").<br /> <br /> Kristin Scott-Thomas (""The English """" shows no. This is one of her better films, and it offers great production and smooth performance as opposed to the strength of Ford's Quiet Man.<br /> <br /> The subplot works great, especially for police corruption. Serves related to Ford's character investigation Plot. In the Dutch investigation into police corruption, find the cold and effective turn of the ""fever"" actor Dennis Haysbert, who plays Detective George Beaufort, an obstacle to overcome. <br /> <br /> The rest of the support cast is great. pleasure. Charles S. Dutton (played for a long time playing the film) is one of the best character actors in his career, and in this piece, the extremely strong Bonnie Hunt steals most of her scenes into stunning scenes. A charming smile like Wendy Judd. <br /> <br /> The technical side of the Pollock Thriller is the best. From Dave Grusin's (Pollack's “The Firm”) to a perfectly surreal jazz score, Philippe Rousselot (“A River Runs Through It”), and clear photo editing, despite the film's unfortunate lower premises From crisp editing to keep it fresh. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone who combines good mystery yarn, well-decorated plots, character-driven stories, and romance all in one. This is a great story about betrayal and forgiveness. It is also the most amazing but delightful and will be the end of a recent debate on Harrison Ford films. ""Random Heart"" is definitely one of the best movies of the year. <br /> <br /> (*** 1 ** * 1/2 of) or (8.5 of 10.0)","A mature, educated film for the audience...<br /> <br /> I saw ""Random Hearts"" in a pre-screening shortly before its release in North America.

However, this photo has some very lively advantages. <br /> <br /> Harrison Ford (""Star Wars"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""The Fugitive"", ""Air"" Force One, """"Patriotic Game""), the highest box office in history, is in a hurry. At the top of his game as a desperate home secretary and Dutchman, Ford's highly discreet and nuanced performance can be achieved with class and determination to pull the audience into a world of loss and betrayal. This is a perfectly complex role, and a very different type of film for Harrison Ford to decorate the screen during his action blockbuster. The following year, Harrison Ford played in the summer of 2000. First returned to action as director Robert Zemeckis (“Forrest Gump”, “Back to the Future”) in the thriller “What Lies Beneath” and Clancy's “sum of all fears” was featured in Tom's filmization later this year. ..

Charles S.

From vivid photos ranging from Dave Grusin (Polac's ""The Farm"") to a completely surrealistic jazzy score to Phillip Rousslot (""A Riverlands Through It""), film the film despite the film's unfortunate premise. Even sharp editing that makes you feel fresh. <br /> <br /> This movie is highly recommended for anyone who enjoys riddles, fast-paced plots, character-driven stories and romance in one. This is a wonderful story of betrayal and forgiveness. It also features one of the most amazing, yet touching and controversial sure endings of recent Harrison Ford movies. ""Random Hearts"" is arguably one of the best films of the year. <br /> <br /> (**** to **** 1/2) or (10.0 to 8.5)"

It may not be universally required, but I think there are many people who like this kind of movie like me, so there will be a market for DVD versions. I expected to have!"

"I absolutely loved this movie! I hesitated at first because I thought it was so painful. I remember how hard it was when John was shot. But watching ""the two of us,"" he returned to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility. I think the writer did an amazing job of describing ""maybe"". Aidan Quinn, like Paul, met a lovely and challenging head. I was impressed by his accent and mannerism. Jared Harris was also very talented and trustworthy like John.

"I had two reasons when this swashbuckler was aired on Danish television yesterday. First of all, I wanted to see Gina Lollobrigida. And here I am not disappointed. She looked gorgeous. Secondly, as I read about the film, I was impressed by the absurd humor that I would see in the film by Philip de Broca. However, this explanation sadly disappointed me. I knew the jokes were predictable (aside from the witty remarks on the subject of the war) and the character was completely one-dimensional. In addition, the action scene was performed in a non-dramatic and strangely mechanical and uninspired way. I kept watching until the end but it got very boring and sat there waiting for the scene with Lollobrigida.","When I aired this swashbuckler on Danish TV yesterday, I had two reasons.

"This film is a dislike of everything worthy of filmmaking. The lead amazes the audience by not actually acting. We must see almost 2 hours of his soulless face. The joke is all the lameness that never laughed on Saturday night. Five of us laughed while drinking beer. And we wore this and we could feel all the warmth and color coming out of the room. At the end of the movie, the atmosphere was ruined, so we all went on separate paths and ruined the night! Yes, pros and cons are suitable for Bluay boasting a beautiful setting in Hawaii against the worst behavior;.... You can say that everyone involved is thinking about payday Zero predictable bad conspiracy Zero character development Flat joke. . Many scenes of the fair male penis act better than that and are more charismatic. I hope all the producers of this film will be ashamed of their heads and catch the relaxed boy cheaply.","This movie hates everything that makes a movie fit. The lead actor surprises the audience by not actually acting at all. We have to watch almost two hours on his gentle soulless face. On Saturday night, all the jokes I had never laughed at were horrible. There were five people drinking beer and laughing, but when I put them on, I felt that all the warmth and color had been drained from the room. The movie was over and the mood was ruined, so we all went another way and ruined the night! OK, pros and cons. The beautiful professional environment in Hawaii looks great on Blu-ray. The downside is the worst behavior ever; all involved are only thinking about payday. Predictable poor plot. Zero character development. A forced joke that becomes flat. Many shots of a man's penis that get fairer perform better and have more charisma than he does. May all the makers of this movie be embarrassed, strangled, and loose and masculinity cheap."
"This was my first Gaspar Noe movie I've watched and I have to say I was shocked.I don't mind gore in generally, but this isn't even gore ,it's real butchering. For some of you a couple of scenes may be impossible to see and I mean really disgusting.Leaving aside these aspects, the main ideas revealed here and the dialog are quite brilliant.When you are given a strong argument against bringing a new life into the world and the manner in which it is given, you can't stop and take a minute to think about it.The actors did their job well, representing general masks of a handpick few people found at the bottom of a diseased society.The movie is full of metaphors, but I'll let you figure them out.Don't watch it if you want to have a lite, relaxing time.I recommend this movie to all those of you who want something to think about or simply watch something different of what you find in your average cinema.","This is the first Gaspar Noe movie I have seen and I must say it was shocked.

When you are given a strong argument for bringing a new life to the world, and the way it is given, you can't stop and think about it for a moment.

"I agree with BigAlC. The film actually prepared many cultural differences and practices before living in Japan for a year in 1993. Tom Selleck does a fantastic job as always and the movie is very humorous and educational. I'm a big fan of Tom Selleck's and bless his general charm and charisma Roy part in this part to bring life to the film in a way that no other actor can leave. <br /> <br /> This movie featured a first-class Japanese actor, and it was very fun to see the actors when interacting with Selleck.

"I laughed so much because my face hurt in this movie. Ben Affleck was funny and reminded of the pretty boy Jack Black who played this role. Gandol Fini shows a typical A performance. The whole cast is funny, the story is pretty good, and the cartoon moments are great. I went into this movie that I probably don't expect so much. So I was completely pleased and surprised that the face came out of the movie. I would recommend this movie to someone who enjoys comedies, identifies loneliness during the holidays and/or hangs out with relatives. The most important part of the movie (to me anyway) was the subtlety of the maniac. In other words, it is a scene related to the lighting of the Christmas tree. Go and see and smile!","I laughed so hard during this movie. My face hurts. Ben Affleck was hilarious and reminded of the cute boy Jack Black who played this role.

The best part of this movie (for me anyway) was the subtleties of humor, completely alert and laughing forever after the rest of the audience stopped. In other words, the scene where the lights of the Christmas tree are involved. Look at it and have a good laugh!"
"Even though I lived in Australia in 1975, I moved abroad shortly thereafter and fell into the general cult of constant industrial anxiety and mediocre -. The compassion of many Australians who chose to ignore the pace of the rapid change that occurs in countries in the north. <br /> <br /> So I missed The Dismissal with Wildside along with other Australian-produced TV dramas from the 80s and 90s like the best Janus and Phoenix series I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> To me the filmed story about dismissal is fair and accurate. But when it comes to the ""anger"" of the public, it shows only one side of the picture, not a controversial family. I know because the two brothers haven't told me for months. <br /> <br /> But this opinion is very unilateral in my opinion as a whole. The inevitable fact is that despite the expression of intense anger from a large number of communities, Australian voters once again made a favorable decision to Fraser two years later.","I lived in Australia in 1975, but soon after I moved abroad, tired of constant industrial unrest and the general worship of mediocrity. -And the self-satisfaction of so many Australians who chose to ignore the pace of rapid change taking place in northern countries. <br /> <br /> As a result, I missed The Dismissal as well as many other Australian TV dramas of the 80s and 90s, such as the great Janus and Phoenix series I've seen, Wildside.

The film features pubic devices that are still widespread to this day when maternity wards are much more controlled and limited, but giving birth in a typical municipal hospital in 1932 grandmothers and grandmothers. I found the movie interesting and surprisingly moving. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, the best performance in this film is that male cast member Eric Linden is like Grace's (Loretta Young) husband Jed Sutton. I'm an actor! The first father, Jed, is confused and anxious about the hospital staff who are confusing their worries because the hospital staff can shed bread crumbs at the restaurant table. I felt all his worries keenly. I want to see more of this actor's work. He had an unforgettable effect as he disappeared with the wind. In the movie, Eric played a young soldier who had amputated a leg without anesthesia. ""Don't cut it! Don't cut it!"" Scarlet teasing when she runs away from the hospital! Another great performance is from Aline MacMahon, who plays nurse Miss Bowers. Her personality is the salt of the earth's type, we are all kind of nurses nursing for hospital stays, and people who constantly violate hospital rules to demonstrate a more humane aspect of the medical profession. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young did another great acting job. It is a performance that feels very authentic and deep like Grace. My she is good at this free code. I have rated this. <br /> <br /> Glenda Farrell is my taste (no one knew that branding a hot water bottle in 1932 could be detrimental to the health of an unborn baby?) But her personality eventually restrained herself. <br /> <br /> Sadly, her Italian husband was a ruthless Gilbert Roland, a silent movie star. His screen time was short, but notable. <br /> <br /> Life Begins is a must-see precoding, and TCM tries to catch it someday, but a few","The Beginning and End of Life-In a typical 1930s birth/recovery ward, the life of several high-risk pregnant women played by Loretta Young, Glenda Farrell, Clara Brandick (Antiem???), and Vivian Osbourne 48 Watching time, Dorothy Tree, Gloriacia, while waiting for childbirth.

I realized all his concerns. I want to see more of this actor's work. He had a very emotional voice, which was used with the wind for an unforgettable effect.

"I think the manuscript for this movie was written on toilet paper. Essentially, don't respect the many important details that make a movie.

What a name, I laughed for days while thinking about it. Effects on Karadzic and Mladic. Second, Serbs have never been terrorized. Reporters like the main character should know it.

"* Spoilers are not mentioned in the criticism * <br /> <br /> There is very little user feedback, but this film has no problems with slander. The film was stink, and half an ordinary star is probably too high for such a pulp. The bone collector, despite the claims of the ad, is not the silence of the Lamb or the caliber of movies like Seven. This is a perfect example of how not to play a thriller. The speed of this movie is very slow. I actually left for about half a minute and never went back to the exact scene with the exact same character. (See the section of Angelina Jolie's character discussing Denzel. Cut the body hand). This film is not scary at all, but I'll try to complement this with the sexy Angelina Jolie's character and Denzel Washington's love subplot Of course, what you get is a mentor-as you can see in the silence of the great epic sheep with Hannibal Lecter and Starling. It would be comparable to student relations however. This lacks all of the effects and has been personally routed to help the villain kill. Denzel off to avoid giggling hacked between the two. In such a terrible movie, I ended up plotting to give the credit that ordinary movies such as Allington Road and Scream came to mind in the movie. Expecting a twist-twist or some kind of verbose situation A person with a 4th grade education can see how the ending will be resolved (similar to Alfred Hitchcock's rear window). The murderer couldn't fully explain his motives, but the reason was so stupid that he sprinkled latte on the screen. I think Denzel happily recovered from the loss for the proverbial'Chess Game' and lived with the pet project Angelina and the killer's intentions were completely gone. <br /> <br /> If you watched a movie, you wouldn't like it with an original concept (like me). If you haven't been in one movie in your life and want to talk about all the Hollywood movies you've been through so far (other people's late night knocks), then you're a serial killer. If you're trying to listen to the terrible'female dominant male aka SOTL), watch this movie... but then it will be too slow and boring.","*Criticism mentions spoilers* <br /> <br /> I rarely make user comments, but this is one movie I've had no problems with slander.

". Perhaps it's a spoiler. You have to say it's one of the worst movies of ""Cinderella II: Dreams come true."" First of all, the movie was made in the sequel to Disney's sequel, ""The Little Mermaid II"", ""The Jungle Book II."" It was made around the same time as ""and"" Peter Pan II, and it was all an obstacle to the original movie classic.

I'm an avid supporter of good Disney movies, and I'm the original Disney"" Cinderella. The sequel to ""I like it."" But the sequel to ""Cinderella"" was a waste of time. The character of Cinderella in the sequel was very different from the original girl. The original Cinderella was kind and lovely, and the new Cinderella was the phrase of the present era. I'll do it my way!” Cinderella (really named after her) says “Ewww!.” It's Cinderella, trying to find the best of the people, but one of her half-sisters, Anastasia, is good. Why are they Tremaine? Made it look like a lady and Drizella is just a terrible family for the poor little Anasta sia My question about the world!..: Did the Disney people see the original ""Cinderella"" when they made this sequel? Well, it definitely doesn't look like that if I remember correctly , Anastasia was abusive to Cinderella as much as Drizella and Lady Tremaine. I was all about redemption and forgiveness, but there was no point of redemption for Anastasia in this movie. First, Anastasia was evil. Second, she's good. I can't leave a story like this, I hope Disney realizes that, among other films, this movie is ashamed of Walt Disney's name, perhaps when Michael Eisne r disappears, things will start forming around the mouse house.","Possibly spoilers, probably.

The new Cinderella had a very unique moment in the phraseology of the present era, such as ""I will do this banquet my own way!"" The new Cinderella (I loved her name) says ""Ewww!"". It's anti-Cinderella. I try to find the best of the people, but in the sequel one of my sisters Anastasia is nice! What on earth? why? They all made everything so that Lady Tremaine and Dorizela are part of the horrific family of poor little Anastia. My Question to the World: Did the Disney people see the original ""Cinderella"" when making this sequel? Well, it certainly doesn't seem to be the case. If I remember correctly, Anastasia was as cruel to Cinderella as Drizela and Lady Tremaine. I'm all asking for redemption and forgiveness, but in this movie there was no point in redeeming Anastasia. In the first, Anastasia was evil. Second, she is fine. I can't leave a story like this. We hope Disney recognizes that, among other movies, it is shaking Walt Disney's name.

This movie is really fun, and if this movie is not fun, it really needs treatment and is a humor for all areas of society including race (predictable), class division, love, wealth, employment, dreams, comedy, and more. <br /> <br /> But I was disappointed. As I entered the movie, I didn't realize that it was actually a remake of another very good movie ""Heaven Can Wait"" produced with Warren Beatty in 1971. When I saw this movie, I was very surprised, and the plot began to unravel in order to become distinct from the old movie I saw on TV a few weeks ago. This movie, in my opinion, takes you every second of the week at any time of the year simply because of the fact that two of them are simply more interesting than other regions and Chris Rock is Warren Beatty. <br /> <br /> Adapt well to the actual plot of the movie. <br /> <br /> Don't ruin your own experience! Do not read the plot! There have been two reviews on IMDb so far, so go watch the movie. See it because it's the most fun thing you've ever seen. See it because it is a cinema experience.

"Formula film about the illegal son of a wealthy Chilean. Taking over fortune and mingling with the work of bad people, you fall in love with a beautiful female lawyer (Vargas). It looks like a TV movie that isn't really exciting. The only reason I bothered to see it because Valentina Vargas was in it. It's nice to meet Vargas, but nothing surprising here. Nice Chilean scenery is on display, but the part of Malcolm McDowell is very small and doesn't help much with the movie. Michael Ironside is a bad guy as usual, but this is the most memorable reason and not part of it.","A formula film about the wealthy Tyrrhenian illegitimate son who is in a position of inheriting property, caught in the case of a bad guy, and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (Vargas).

"The rating I give to BOOM is due to the excellent location photos of Sardinia and Rome. Otherwise this is only for hardcore addicts of ELIZABETH TAYLOR (lower level) and RICHARD BURTON (lower level of misunderstanding). Tennessee Williams wrote, ""The Milk Train no longer stops here."" I love this adaptation to his play, but I'm definitely the only one. Taylor hated hatred and Burton said he needed money. <br /> <br /> Taylor reaches the bean hill where she poses, acts in an eerie way, explodes to the species and exchanges bad baby stories. <br /> <br /> It's too ambitious enough to be considered a ""must see"" kind among Taylor fans. But if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand, you are ahead of me. Sadly, this is a movie that means Taylor was seriously filmed as a movie star even after winning two Oscars. For Button it was equally catastrophic and critics called it BOMB. Dare to judge for yourself.","Whatever rating I give BOOM is just for the great location photos of Sardinia and Rome.

But if you can sit on this without a drink in your hands, you are far ahead of me.

"VIVA LA BAM This ""Jackass"" participle focuses on (clearly scripted) adventures of Bam Margera and his friends (Johnny Knoxville, Brandon Dicamillo, etc.). The show has quite a lot of severe comedy and crazy stunts, but it focuses on torture to Bam's parents. <br /> <br /> Bam, I'm sorry... It's not as cool as you think. This ego trip show is not only painlessly fun (I liked Jackass), but also narcissistic beyond faith. The overly-formed introduction coolly explains that Bam will do the ""F***"" he wants. How about doing something really fun? I liked ""Jackass"" for that value. Camera work was terrible. Any fool could make a better show with a camcorder in his parents' garage, but at least the show moved at a steady pace and never felt bored between the crazy, dangerous or disgusting stunts a friend performed.<br /> < br /> This is not the case with ""Viva la Bam"". We follow our hero while teasing relatives with his friends as a joke, but we never really feel anything other than a lame and scripted comedy. Stunts and pranks are a bit fun, but they are presented in a boring and boring way and can barely make you laugh. <br /> <br /> ""Viva la Bam"" is a bad spin off.

"I had never heard of Larry Fessenden before but judging by this effort into writing and directing, he should keep his day job as a journeyman actor. Like many others on here, I don't know how to categorize this film, it wasn't scary or spooky so can't be called a horror, the plot was so wafer thin it can't be a drama, there was no suspense so it can't be a thriller, its just a bad film that you should only see if You were a fan of the Blair witch project. People who liked this film used words, like ""ambiguity"" and complex and subtle but they were reading into something that wasn't there.

Finally, when something does happen, its not even clear how the father was shot, how he dies, (the nurse said his liver was only grazed), and all the time this wendigo spirit apparently tracks down the apparent shooter in a very clumsy way with 3rd grade special effects.The film is called Wendigo but no attempt is made to explain it in any clear way, the film ends all muddled and leaves you very unsatisfied, i would have bailed out with 15 minutes to go but I wanted to see if this movie could redeem itself.It didn't.","I had never heard of Larry Fessenden, but judging from the writing and directing of this effort, he should continue his daily work as a traveler actor.

"Schlocky 70's horror movie... Unlike today's boring slasher movie, this K-tel special actually does a terrifying job and doesn't rely on a tired formula. <br /> <br /> This is a B movie about making B movies. Terriblely wrong. Faith Domergue (this island district) is a B movie queen on the hill, making a movie about a series of terrible murders that bother families at home. Her boyfriend/director, who looks and acts like Gordon Jump, is filming the film according to location and schedule. Ken Doll's co-star found that Tibetan songs work as scripts to add ""realism"". Unfortunately, ""realism"" was something they could do without. <br /> <br /> John Carradine has long since given up on finding the 17th Gland (The Unearthly) and is now a property. He does his daily work, but he always seems to be afraid of the director. <br /> <br /> Fear builds up slowly. Here, a dead cat, John Carradine, entered the tomb and finally killed seven and seven people. (At least there is a truth in the advertisement.) It's sad that Ghoul didn't understand that his movie was on top of it. What was your poor faith in knowing that these Tibetan chants actually worked?

"I thought this movie was ""cool"" in 1961, but looking back now (45 years), it was as stupid as the entertainment value! Of course, special effects are well applied to TVs in a series that started in 1964, but are suitable for BIG screens. I once had an exciting fishbowl! I must agree to the Octopus scene near the end attached to Seaview. Obviously the stage is not good or not trained! Overall, it's a pretty bad behaviour with quirky special effects and still recommends it for a funny laugh. It was probably one of Irwin Allen's biggest films. Barabara Eden continued to play ""Genie"" on TV Micheal Ansara. Now this is the cool part of the movie! I always enjoyed watching my husband and wife teams appear in the same movie. neat!","I think the movie was considered ""cool"" in 1961, but looking back (45 years), its appeal was as silly as entertainment value! Sure, special effects work well on TVs in the series that started in 1964, but for BIG screens? I used to have an aquarium that was just as exciting! You have to agree on the last scene where the octopus scene sticks to the seaview. Obviously not staged...or trained! Overall, it's a pretty bad act with tinsel special effects, and I recommend it-for a fun laugh. This is probably one of Irwin Allen's greatest films and I think he thought a lot. Separated Eden continued to play ""Genie"" on T.V. Michelle Ansara was her husband. This is the cool part of this movie!

"Tsui Hark's.. One of the best movies from Hong Kong's'New Wave' that started in ""ZU: Warriors of Magic Mountain."" Tsui has set the tone for New Wave's approach to martial arts films, ie these films have since The approach to it requires more than an ironic touch unless it is a comedy. ""Burning Paradise"" stops all of this and takes revenge. <br /> <br /> It is not without humor. But it's a pure human humor, like the early Buddhist priesthood, that manages the quick feel of an older young prostitute while hiding in a straw bundle. But, like humans, even Buddhist priests cannot always be saints. <br /> <br /> When irony was finally introduced to the movie, it was the most stupid. Red Lotus Temple, a pure nihilism study that has never been recorded in a movie before. He is in ""The Lost Paradise"", ""It is the incarnation of Milton Satan. ""It is better to rule in hell than to serve in heaven!"" And if he cannot get to Satan's hell soon, he is alive to rule the world around him. It's going to turn to hell.<br /> <br /> Here's a theme that highlights the brutal violence of many images: Abbot doesn't want to kill people, he's desperate, completely hopeless, and his nihilism. We want to accept everything as an all-encompassing reality, so there is a clear meaning in the red temple scene that there may be no other reality outside the temple itself: everything in the universe came into existence, the abbot of the abbot who claims infinite mastery of power <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie doesn't end there, although there are losses, humans will be humans in the usual way (see the movie if you want to know how!) But this movie When we see, we visit Hell, hopefully we don't see our own afterlife, but we certainly feel like we're being chased by the experience.","This is one of the best movies out of Hong Kong's ""New Wave"" that began with Tui Hark's ""ZU: The Magic Mountain Warrior"". Tsui set the tone for the new wave approach to martial arts movies. Almost all directors of New Wave (Jackie Chan, Samohan, Won Jin, Ching Si Tung, etc.) have since taken it for granted. In other words, approaching such a movie would require more than a touch of irony, even if it was not an open comedy. ""Burning Paradise"" stopped at all of it and took revenge. <br /> <br /> Not without humor here. But it's purely human humor, like an old Buddhist monk who somehow manages to manage the nimble feel of a young young prostitute while hiding in a bunch of straw. However, this cannot always be a saint, even Buddhist monks, as humans are. <br /> <br /> When irony was finally introduced into the movie, it's the most annoying thing possible, the Red Lotus Temple. He is a researcher of pure voidness that has never been recorded in a movie. He is just the incarnation of Milton's devil from ""Paradise Lost"": ""It is better to rule in hell than to serve in heaven!"" And if he cannot reach Satan's hell immediately, he Turning the world around into a living hell, he can rule. <br /> <br /> That's the motif that highlights many of the brutal violence in the images here: The abbot isn't just trying to kill people. He despairs of them, feels desperate at all, and wants to accept his voidness as a comprehensive reality. Thus, there is a clear sense in the Red Temple scene that there may be no other reality outside the temple itself. It becomes everything that exists in the universe and is in charge of the abbot who claims control of infinite power. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the movie doesn't end there. There is a loss, but humans finally become ordinary humans. (Watch the movie if you want to know how!) But when we watch this movie, we definitely go to hell. Hopefully we don't witness after our death. But we are certainly frustrated with that experience."

"Stephane Audran is the progenitor of this beautifully measured study of the Danish small community at the end of the last century. The two beautiful and musically talented sisters give up their prospects for happiness and marriage to care for their older father. One day a French woman, Barbet, works for them. A few years later she decided to do something for the sisters who won the lottery and took her. Her solution is to prepare an exquisite and colorful feast that will change the lives of all invited people. This is a film about the interaction of humans and culture reflected in the language of dialogue, changing from Danish to French, especially between the cruelty of Protestantism in Northern Europe and the senses of the Catholic South. It is also about how warmth and kindness can be expressed and stimulated through the cultivation of human needs and sensations. A movie that greatly enhances.","Stephen Audran is the heroine of this beautifully acclaimed study of a small Danish community towards the end of the last century.

Years later, she won the lottery and decided to do something for the sisters who accepted her. Her solution is to prepare an exquisite and luxurious feast that will change the lives of all invited people. This film about human-cultural interaction is reflected in the linguistic change of the Danish to French dialogue, especially between the faithful calm of Protestant Northern Europe and the sensual sensation of the Southern Catholic. It is also about human needs and how warmth and tenderness are expressed and stimulated through the development of sensations. An exciting movie."
"This movie was way over-hyped.A lot of the viewers, who thought this was ""amazing"" must have been into the old school movies, cause the whole movie is set in the past.At first I thought the movie was just showing something From this past, so I was expecting that faded dreamy like lighting on the characters to pass, but it just going.Basically this was a movie trying to mix the future with the past, and the 2 don't mix very well in this movie , even with special effects.You could actually see the blue screen the actors were working with.There are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did, so there is no reason for critics to hype this movie up saying ""it's the greatest movie ever done"".It's just crap on a stick.It also didn't help that the story line was sooo crappy.I don't understand why Hollywood agreed to have this movie produced, and I also don't understand how actors /actresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this.It's almost as though ever ybody read the script and forgot to read the fine print...""It will all be done on a computer"".This was a movie that should have been on a movie network, because nothing about this movie was revolutionary.I'm very upset with myself for paying money to see this.Whatever you do, don't waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow.","This movie was a hype. Many viewers who thought this was ""wow"" must have had an interest in old movies. This is because the whole movie was set in the past. At first I thought the film was just a thing of the past, so I thought it would fade like a character's lighting like a dream, but that's it. Basically, this is a movie that tries to mix the future and the past, and the two don't mix well with the special effects in this movie. In fact, you can see the blue screen the actor is using. There are so many movies that do exactly what it did, so there is no reason for critics to advertise it as ""the best movie ever"". It's just crap. It also didn't help the story being so cheap. I don't know why Hollywood agreed to make this movie. I also don't know if the actor/actress in this movie is willing to appear in such a movie. It's as if everyone has forgotten to read the script and read the small sentences... ""It's all done on the computer."" This was a movie that should have been on the movie network, as it wasn't revolutionary. I am very angry that I paid to see this. Whatever you do, don't waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow."
"It is surprising that there are two films with the same story released in 2005. The movie came out with Tom Cruise a day ago. Didn't they do that with Truman Capote in the same year and the zodiac killer last year? Interesting. <br /> <br /> Author/Director David Michael Latt did not have Steven Spielberg's budget, and C. Thomas Howell is not Tom Cruise. This is a pale imitation of Blockbuster, which has earned $580 million worldwide.

"I sometimes... you try and try and try to philanthropize all the B-Z movies there, but certain movies test patience until you want to hit everyone involved sometimes. ""Bat People"" (what I saw at night with the title ""It Lives By Night"") is such a movie. You can't watch this movie without actually thinking it should have been an episode of ""Night Gallery"". <br /> <br /> The movie is related to the bat bite doctor and as a result it begins to transform into a Were-Bat, which drinks human blood. (Actually, you would think that if he turned into a real bat, he would be eating a mosquito with a gallon bucket, but this is a cheap, terrible horror movie, so blood is a word. Almost every night, his friend and fellow doctor, Dr. Mustache Aspen-Extreme, claims to be'allergic to rabies'. Meanwhile, the world's most unobtrusive and stereotypical county sheriff suspects the doctor responsible for the brutal murder and dissolution of several local girls (and one wino). Also, the doctor's wife decides that the rejection is the river IS in Egypt, alternately sponsors him and distracts him. <br /> <br /> Acting is not bad. You can see that the actor is making a professional level choice, and even the sheriff is trying to bring juice and life into the script. (Okay, it's bad, but bad in a cliché and wooden professional way). Everything about acting, the pace of the scene, costumes, conversations, scripts and storylines wants to set your teeth as an edge and hit everyone involved. <br /> <br /> I think the movie had an outside chance like a spooky and uneasy little cult, but <br /> <br /> 1) The director had to beat the experienced character actor Michael Pataki with a chair. P ataki until he agreed to the ACT as well as the channel Dennis Dennis 2) He also wrote a more understandable script regarding the entire ""bat bite, then turn into a bat"" scenario. I had to find it. <br /> <br /> 3) He also demanded that the actor who played the role of a doctor should find a more physically reliable stage business for his'Episode' without resorting to the'Little Man's Seizure' page. The golden book of cliché mannerisms. <br /> <br /> 4) He had to rework the entire'wife' character and make her more intelligent, less, less, and more observable. <br /> <br /> Without the help of Mike and Bots, I would never watch this movie again voluntarily. It's bad, but it's not bad in a silly, humorous or fun way. It's still better than ""Battlefield Earth"" or ""Waterworld"".","I don't know from time to time...you try to philanthrop all the B-to-Z grade movies out there, but occasionally a particular movie until you want to slap everyone involved. Just test your patience. ""Bat People"" (seen under the title ""It Lives By Night"") is just such a movie. This cannot be seen without thinking that it should really be an episode of ""Night Gallery"". <br /> <br /> This movie has something to do with a doctor who begins to transform into a human blood-draining wear bat bitten by a bat. (Actually, if he had turned into a real bat, I think he was eating mosquitoes by a gallon bucket, but this is a cheap and funny horror movie, so blood is a word. ) After having a big seizure the moment he put on his hat and having a blackout episode almost every night, his friend and colleague, Dr. Mustache Aspen-Extreme, had an ""allergic reaction"" to a rabies attack.

Requested to find. Cliche Golden Maniac book. <br /> <br /> 4) He had to recreate the whole character of the ""wife"" to make her more intelligent, less shrill, and watch closely. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't spontaneously watch this movie again without the cooperation of Mike and Bot.

"Big Fat Liar is what you get when you combine terrific writing, great production, and an emphasis on clever ideas over adolescent pap. The two stars work great together, and--what can I say?

If I didn't laugh all the time, I wouldn't have been paying attention."
"Tim Robbins and John Cusack were two grateful actors throughout their career, the only reason they chose to watch this movie. Well, all I can say is I regret it! These two great actors make people laugh, but they completely insult themselves by performing several unrelated, imaginative and kitsch for unexpected and unexpected (this is not bad) sketches. The only reason I can think of is because the director was a friend and I decided to support the movie by appearing in the movie, so this movie is so cheap that I can't think of anything else! Fortunately, Tim Robbins and John Kussac haven't been disappointed ever since. If you don't want to spoil your opinion on both actors, it's better to avoid this movie.","Tim Robbins and John Cusack were two actors that have been highly appreciated throughout their careers, and that was the only reason they chose to watch this movie. Well, all I can say is that I totally regret it! Although these two great actors are supposed to make people laugh, they can't do so many unimaginative acts that aren't relevant to the extreme (which isn't bad by itself) sketches. By doing, you are much more humiliating. The only reason I can think of is that the directors are their friends and they have decided to support his film by starring his film. Fortunately, Tim Robbins and John Cusack haven't let me down since then. Unless you want your opinion that the two actors have been spoiled, I recommend avoiding this movie."
"Watching this movie, I was amazed at how media perception can present celebrity opinions. Karen Carpenter was a carefree, but very unconfident young woman. His great voice helped her and her brother Richard to raise the charts with great songs. Like all celebrities today, they are often criticized for music, appearance, style, and more. Karen has had a big impact on her diet and her weight loss. This feeling felt that the movie wasn't what I first saw and thought. But when I started seeing it, I fell in love. In the same way as Tina Turner's story, this film illuminates you and lets you see the lives of young performers. The acting was great and after almost 20 years the direction and conversation is still enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it yet. It is surprisingly accurate and emotionally charged.","After watching this movie, I was surprised at how the perception of the media can shape the opinions of celebrities. Karen Carpenter was a carefree but very unconfident young woman. Her wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard to soar up the chart with a great song. Like all celebrities today, they are often criticized for their music, looks and style. This intensified her dietary fight and had a major impact on Karen, who eventually caused her death. This heart wasn't what I originally wanted to see in the movie. But when I started to see it, I got hooked. Just like the story of Tina Turner, this movie can enlighten you and see the lives of young performers. The acting was great, and even after about 20 years since it was made, the direction and dialogue are still interesting. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it yet. It's amazingly accurate and emotionally charged."
"Nothing is sacred. Ask Ernie Fosselius. Nowadays, everyone has a video camera, tricks start to fly, write quickly, and even without a movie before being filmed, they are posted directly on the Internet. Spoofing is hot these days, so we're trying to keep filmmakers out of their importance. When the first Star Wars was created 25 years ago, it was a different world. Filmmaking was a small number of playgrounds and spoofing was very rare. And God gave us a hardware war. The audio was clearly recorded after the fact (or wasn't it just cheap?) to make it look cheap. Are you out of that experience? No! That is why it is so big! It was primitive and unpolished, constantly bumping into the harshest moments of the original movie. From Fluke Starbucker waving a flashlight instead of a lightsaber (when he was a kid!) to Wookie Monster Chewchilla, Auggie Ben Doggie's ""Oh, A Little Headache"" announcement, this film short story is like a real Star Wars movie.

"It's really vague. I hate self-awareness that is disguised as art. This movie is silly crazy or silly crazy. After 30 minutes in the first half, I quickly sent the DVD version and continued to watch the same youth Shin Nani Gun. I was furious that I spent hard earned money for the sophomoric clap-trap. If you use a tinting drive in sepia or blue, not to mention art, it is not a movie.","hated. I hate the exaggerated dislike of self-awareness in the guise of art. This movie is stupid or stupid or stupid. After the first 30 minutes, I fast-forwarded the DVD version and saw the same boy Shennangan again and again.

"I usually try to be professional and constructive when criticizing movies, but my God! This was the worst movie I've ever seen. Bad behavior, bad influences, bad scripts, everything bad! <br /> <br /> This conspiracy follows a group of teenage clinics heading from a remote island to a frenetic wilderness. However, when the group arrives, only the empty dance floor and bloody clothes are found. To see what happened to the rest of the party, the tribe set out on a mission through a zombie-infected forest. The Crusaders, with the help of police chicks and sea captains, provide each child with the appropriate number of weapons. They also meet Jonathan Cherry and other survivors. Basically, the rest of the movie is a collection of misdirected action sequences, including shootouts that are too long outside the ""Dead's House"". The fight ended with noisy Hollywood violence, duplicate clips from HOTD video games, and camera rotations like a crude matrix. One of the character's volunteers also sacrifices himself to save others. Why? Not because he was noble and brave, but because the zombie was hurt by acid after hitting the creature for a long time after his face was deactivated! Should I feel sorry for this guy?! ? <br /> <br /> To put it all together, there is no point in watching this movie. The theater I was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen, and I am convinced that the wasted money can easily afford the cost of making it. Grade:F","I always try to be professional and constructive when criticizing a movie, but my god!!! This was the worst movie I have ever seen.

"If you're going to see something like this in a film history class or school like me, convince your teacher to see something else. Believe me, nothing is better than this movie. Slow, confusing, boring, poorly structured, messy, funny, should I continue? The message is good, but I saw it handled better in many other movies. Acting is also not good. This film is fun because it's a surreal story rather than the end (although not intense), but more awkward because it starts. <br /> <br /> Honestly 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life was robbed. Why girls portray a trio for 10 minutes, see a drive through a traffic jam for 20 minutes, hear hippies that can make sheep appear, witness some sort of rape, and see the female lead role eat Her husband. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this film is only a tenth. And if you're not satisfied with the preview, I'm an open minded person and I love movies protesting through symbolism, but this movie was terrible. Excuses as much as possible to avoid this movie.","If you, like me, are trying to watch this at school, such as in a movie history class, then let your teacher see something else.

"This is like a zoology textbook, given that its depiction of animals is so accurate.However, here aa few details that appear to have been slightly modified during the transition to film:<br /><br />- Handgun bullets never hit giant Komodo dragons.

Maybe the computer-generated nature of these dragons has something to do with it.<br /><br />- When filming a news story aiming on exposing illegal animal testing, a reporter and a cameraman with one camera is all the gear and personnel you will need; sound gear, a second camera, microphones etc are all superfluous.<br /><br />- When you hear a loud animal scream, and one person has a gun, he should take it out and point it at the nearest person. <br /><br />- When you take a gun out, the sound of the safety being taken off will be made, even if your finger is nowhere near the safety<br / ><br />- Reporters agree to go Half-way around the world in order to expose something-without having the faintest idea what they're exposing.Background research and vague knowledge are out of fashion in modern journalism.<br /> <br />- Handguns hold at least 52 bullets in one clip, and then more than that in the next clip.Despite that, those with guns claim that they will need more ammo.<br /><br />- Expensive cameras (also, remember that the reporter only has one camera) are regularly left behind without even a moment's hesitation or regret.
